> I'm [[ColivingLiguria/People/Simone Testino|Simone]], the founder of [[ColivingLiguria]]. This page is my story. It’s about the personal frustrations that sparked this idea and the professional need that turned it into a mission. This is why I’m building the place I couldn't find.

### The Search

It all started with a search. I’m a student, and for most of my life, I’ve bounced between Italy, Switzerland, and Germany, driven by a dual passion for big ideas (philosophy) and complex problems (mathematics).

In 2024, I was planning my next move—to Amsterdam for my [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]]—after finishing my [[B.A. Philosophy (LMU)]] and while wrapping up my [[B.Sc. Mathematics (LMU)]]. But as I looked for a place to live, I was hit by a wave of frustration. The rent was impossibly high. The options were small, uninspiring rooms in shared flats.

I found myself searching for something that felt just out of reach, a place that could be:
* **Affordable:** A place where I wouldn't have to stress about rent just to have a roof over my head.
* **Communal:** I wanted to be surrounded by interesting, driven people, not just anonymous roommates.
* **In Nature:** I craved space, fresh air, and a view that wasn’t a brick wall.
* **Connected:** I didn't want to be forced into buying a car. I needed reliable public transport to stay autonomous and connected.

I searched everywhere. I found expensive city coliving spaces, isolated rural houses with no connections, and cheap spots in cold, grey climates. But the simple combination of community, nature, autonomy, and affordability? It just didn't exist.

So, I decided I would have to build it myself.

### The Accelerator

That personal frustration was only half the story.

At the same time, I was starting to work on my other entrepreneurial project, a hardware startup called **[[Luna]]**. As I planned the R&D, I hit the exact same wall, but from a professional angle.

Where could I possibly find the space to build a lab? What landlord, especially in a city, would let me set up prototyping equipment, test large-scale hardware, and run a workshop?

The answer, again, was nowhere.

That’s when the vision for [[ColivingLiguria]] snapped into focus. This wouldn't just be a solution to my housing problem. It would be the physical **launchpad** for my *other* company—a project that, like [[ColivingLiguria]], has since been validated by securing funding from the [[Bando Pubblico Fesr 2021-2027. OS 1.3]].

### The Solution: An Ecosystem

By finding a large, affordable property complex in Liguria—my home region—I could solve both problems at once.

[[ColivingLiguria]] is the answer to that search. It’s a place to live well for less, but it’s also an ecosystem. It’s the home I was looking for, and it’s the workshop [[Luna]] needed.

My mission is to create the space I couldn't find, not just for me, but for anyone else who feels that same frustration. It's for the remote worker tired of their city apartment, the artist who needs studio space, and the entrepreneur who needs a place to build their first prototype.

This is a place to live, to connect, and to build. It's an open invitation, which you can read more about on our [[ColivingLiguria for Startups and Cofounders|page for entrepreneurs]].
