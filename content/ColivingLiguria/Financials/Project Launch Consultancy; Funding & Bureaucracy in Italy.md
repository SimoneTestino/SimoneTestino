> This page outlines the consultancy services I offer to aspiring entrepreneurs who wish to start a project similar to [[ColivingLiguria]]. I navigated the entire process of securing European funds, writing a business plan, and handling Italian bureaucracy by myself. While doing so, I definitely felt the need for someone who had already been through it. My goal is to use my first-hand experience to help you take the most efficient steps and avoid the mistakes I made.

While I am not academically trained in economics, my background is in Mathematics and Logic from the University of Amsterdam and the University of Munich. This project is the result of extensive self-education and practical, hands-on experience. I am currently studying to become a certified financial advisor in Italy and believe in a fully transparent, "open book" approach, which is why I also share my [[Personal Finance]] journey; on top of this I am also the founder of [[Luna]], a technical startup in the field of illumination for the industry and events. You can learn more about me on my main page: [[ColivingLiguria/People/Simone Testino]].
### Services Offered
My consultancy is designed to provide practical, actionable guidance through every stage of your project's inception, from funding to launch.
#### **1. Securing European Funds**
Finding and successfully applying for public grants is often the biggest hurdle. I can help you:
-   Identify available European and national funds that fit your project's scope, whether it's on a smaller scale like mine (€100k-€300k) or a much larger dimension.
-   Structure and write a compelling business plan tailored for public bodies—a very different skill from writing one for yourself.
-   Prepare and submit all the necessary documentation, drawing from my successful application for the [[Bando Pubblico Fesr 2021-2027. OS 1.3]], which resulted in the [[Comunicazione Esito Positivo della Domanda.pdf|official approval of funds]].
#### **2. Navigating Italian Bureaucracy**
The administrative side can be daunting. I can guide you through:
-   **Company Formation:** Understanding why you need a legal entity (like a *Ditta Individuale* or S.r.l.s.) to receive funds and how to set one up.
-   **Certifications & Permits:** Identifying which certifications are required for your specific business and which offices to contact.
-   **General Bureaucracy:** Providing a roadmap for handling the entire administrative process to save you time and stress.
#### **3. Operations & Project Management**
-   **Volunteer Management:** How to find volunteers, legally frame their contribution with contracts, and handle insurance matters.
-   **Rental Management:** Structuring rental agreements, pricing, and managing guest relations for short-term and long-term stays.
#### **4. Digital Presence & Marketing**
-   **Website Creation:** I can help you build your own website, similar to this one, to serve as the central hub for your project.
-   **Social Media & Advertising:** We can develop a targeted strategy for your business niche to attract volunteers, guests, and remote workers, leveraging platforms like our [[Social Media]] channels.
#### **5. Access to a Professional Network**
Launching a project like this requires a team of reliable professionals. I can provide you with my network of contacts in Italy, including:
-   Lawyers (*Avvocati*) and legal experts
-   Accountants (*Commercialisti*)
-   Surveyors (*Geometri*) and construction professionals
-   Financial advisors

### How to Get Started

Having received a number of requests about my process, I have created this page to offer formal consultancy.

Please note that these services will be officially available starting from the end of September, once the initial bureaucracy for my own project is fully completed. Services that require official financial advisory certifications will become available approximately one month later, pending the completion of my certification.

If you are interested in discussing your project in the meantime, the best way to start is by getting in touch with me directly. You can find all my details on the [[Contact]] page.
