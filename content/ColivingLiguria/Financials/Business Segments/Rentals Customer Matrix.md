> This document outlines the rental business segments for Coliving Liguria, which constitute the primary source of the project's cash flow. We will first classify rental types based on their duration, considering the legal framework in Italy. We will then analyse the different purposes for a guest's stay. Finally, we will combine these concepts to create a flexible model for categorising potential customers, acknowledging the hybrid nature of their stays.

The revenue for Coliving Liguria will be generated almost entirely through rentals. To understand our market and structure our offerings, we classify every stay along two primary dimensions: its duration (the temporal dimension) and its purpose (the activity dimension).
#### The Temporal Dimension: Duration of Stay
The length of a rental contract is not just a practical matter; it has significant legal implications in Italy that dictate the type of agreement we can offer. Based on Italian law, we can categorise stays into three main types. Our primary business model, as defined by our ATECO code (`55.90.00 - Altri servizi di alloggio`), is focused on providing accommodation to workers and students.
1.  **Short Stays (Less than 30 days):** These are legally defined as *locazioni brevi* (short-term lets). They are designed for tourism and very brief stays, offering the most flexibility but typically involving higher turnover.
2.  **Transitory Stays (1 to 18 months):** These are covered by *contratti di locazione ad uso transitorio* (transitory rental contracts). This is a crucial category for us, as it legally accommodates students, remote workers, and volunteers staying for a medium-term period. The law requires a justified "transitory reason" from the guest (e.g., a temporary work project, a university course), which fits our target audience perfectly.
3.  **Long Stays (Over 18 months):** Any stay longer than 18 months would typically fall under standard residential contracts (e.g., "4+4"). While we can offer such stays, they are not the primary focus of our business model, which is geared towards a more dynamic community.
#### The Purpose Dimension: Reason for Stay
Beyond the duration, the purpose of a guest's stay defines their relationship with the project. We have identified three primary purposes, which can be mixed and matched. Unlike the linear dimension of time, these are three separate, non-exclusive dimensions.
1.  **Vocational:** This describes a stay purely for holiday and leisure. These guests are here to enjoy the villa and the Ligurian landscape, with no expectation of contributing work. Their financial contribution is a standard rental fee.
2.  **Volunteer:** This describes a stay where the primary purpose is to contribute actively to the villa's renovation, maintenance, or development. In exchange for their work, volunteers receive free or heavily discounted accommodation.
3.  **Remote Worker:** This describes a stay for individuals who use the villa as their base for professional work. They require reliable infrastructure (especially internet) and a productive environment. Their financial contribution is a rental fee, but they benefit from the unique work-life balance the villa offers.
#### The Customer Matrix: A Hybrid Model
If we were to simplify these two dimensions into a discrete matrix, we would get nine basic customer profiles.

|                   | **Short Stay (<1 month)** | **Transitory Stay (1-18 months)** | **Long Stay (>18 months)** |
| :---------------- | :------------------------ | :-------------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| **Vocational**    | Tourist                   | Sabbatical / Extended Holiday     | Resident                   |
| **Volunteer**     | Taster Session            | Project Contributor               | Long-term Volunteer        |
| **Remote Worker** | Workation                 | Digital Nomad                     | Remote Resident            |

However, this matrix is just a guide. The reality is that our guests are often hybrids. One could be a remote worker who also volunteers on weekends, while technically being on an extended holiday. The "purpose" is not a single point but a blend of the three dimensions.

Therefore, for a more precise and future-proof model (which will be crucial when we formalise this into software), we will define each customer not by a single category, but by a set of parameters: the total duration of their stay, and the number of hours they expect to dedicate to each of the three core activities. This allows us to create truly tailored agreements that reflect the unique, hybrid nature of each person's contribution to Coliving Liguria.
### Strategic Targeting: Reaching Our Customer Types
The customer matrix is more than just a classification; it is a strategic tool. By understanding the distinct needs and habits of each of the nine customer types, we can tailor both our investments and our advertising efforts to attract the right people and maximise the appeal of the villa. A one-size-fits-all advertising strategy would be inefficient. Different customer types frequent different online platforms and respond to different messages. Our approach is to use a variety of targeted channels to reach each segment effectively.

|                   | **Short Stay (<1 month)**                                                 | **Transitory Stay (1-18 months)**                                                             | **Long Stay (>18 months)**                              |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Vocational**    | Airbnb, Booking.com, Instagram (targeted tourism ads)                     | Niche travel blogs, "Slow Travel" Facebook groups                                             | Local rental platforms, word-of-mouth referrals         |
| **Volunteer**     | Workaway, Worldpackers (for short "taster" sessions)                      | Specialised volunteer platforms (e.g., for permaculture, renovation), university partnerships | Personal or alternative contancts                       |
| **Remote Worker** | NomadList, Airbnb (monthly stays), targeted digital nomad Facebook groups | Coliving-specific websites (e.g., Coliving.com), LinkedIn, remote work job boards             | Direct community outreach, long-term coliving platforms |

As the table shows, platforms like Airbnb and Booking.com are excellent for attracting short-term vocational guests, but they are less effective for finding long-term volunteers or remote workers. For these segments, we must engage with specific online communities, such as dedicated Facebook groups for digital nomads or platforms like Workaway, which connect volunteers with projects.
