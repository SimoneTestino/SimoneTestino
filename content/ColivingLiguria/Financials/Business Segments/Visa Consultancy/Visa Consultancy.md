> This page serves as an operational index for the **Visa Consultancy** business unit. It consolidates the regulatory knowledge base, standard operational policies, and the financial model for offering paid immigration advice. The strategic goal of this unit is to monetise necessary bureaucratic research while filtering highly motivated candidates for residency.

### Strategic Rationale
Navigating Italian immigration law is time-intensive. Historically, this time was lost to non-serious enquiries. By formalising this knowledge into a paid service, we achieve two goals:
1.  **Revenue Generation:** Monetising expertise at a premium rate (€40/h) that exceeds standard operational opportunity costs.
2.  **Candidate Filtering:** A willingness to pay for consultancy is a strong indicator of a candidate's serious intent and financial viability for long-term residency.

### Operational Framework

#### 1. The Baseline (No-Touch)
Our standard stance remains that we are not a visa agency. Most enquiries must be deflected to our self-service resources to preserve core team bandwidth.
* **Policy:** **[[Visa Assistance Policy]]** - This is the default response to all casual queries.

#### 2. The Premium Product (High-Touch)
For candidates requiring dedicated support, we offer a structured consultancy service. This is the only channel through which I (Simone) will actively engage in visa strategy.
* **Commercial Offer:** **[[Premium Visa Assistance]]** - The public-facing sales page detailing deliverables and pricing.

### Regulatory Knowledge Base (The "Product")
The value of the consultancy relies on deep technical knowledge of specific entry paths relevant to our project. These notes form the core of the paid advice.
* **Tourist Path:** **[[Visto per Turista]]** - Technical notes on leveraging our prepaid contracts to overcome subsistence hurdles for Type C visas.
* **Self-Employment Path:** **[[Visto per Lavoro Autonomo]]** - Technical notes on the highly complex Type D path, including quota management and B2B framework agreements.

### Financial Model
* **Pricing Strategy:** Base rate of **€40/hour (gross)**. This is set higher than standard teaching/consultancy rates (€30/h net) to account for the high administrative intensity and specialised nature of immigration work.
* **Minimum Engagement:** Services are sold in pre-paid blocks (minimum 5 hours = €200) to ensure cash flow before work commences.
* **Invoicing:** Managed strictly via standard **[[Payments]]** infrastructure, requiring specific descriptions for tax compliance.
