> This page serves as a directory for all the independent ventures and projects that are developed and run by residents at Coliving Liguria. These projects are an integral part of our ecosystem, fostering a dynamic and entrepreneurial environment.
### What Are Supplementary Projects?
Supplementary Projects are independent business ideas or initiatives proposed and managed by our residents. They operate by renting spaces and resources from Coliving Liguria but remain the full property of their creators. This model allows our community members to test and grow their own ventures in a supportive environment.
### How to Get Your Project Listed
If you have an idea that you would like to develop at Coliving Liguria, we encourage you to submit a formal proposal. The process is designed to ensure that every project is viable and aligns with our community values.

* For all the details on how to prepare and submit your idea, please see our **[[Propose a Project]]** page.
