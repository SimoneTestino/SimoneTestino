> [!Abstract]  Share Your Idea with Coliving Liguria
> At ColivingLiguria, we believe that great ideas can come from anywhere. This page outlines how you can submit your own project proposals, from small improvements to brand-new ventures. If accepted, your idea will become an official part of our ecosystem, listed on our [[Supplementary Projects]] page.

As the founder and owner of ColivingLiguria, my primary responsibility is to ensure the long-term sustainability and coherence of the entire project. Therefore, every new idea must be evaluated against several key criteria.

My role is to:
1.  **Assess Financial Viability:** I will review your proposal to ensure it aligns with our financial resources, budget, and overall business strategy.
2.  **Ensure Strategic Fit:** I will verify that your project is consistent with the long-term goals and values of Coliving Liguria.
3.  **Prevent Conflicts:** I will check for any interference with other ongoing projects, ensuring that new proposals integrate smoothly with our current and future plans.

Ultimately, as the owner, the final decision on whether to approve and implement a proposal rests with me.

### How to Submit a "Concept Proposal"
To propose an idea, you need to create a document that clearly outlines your vision. It must include the following sections:
1. **Abstract (Max 300 words)**
    * A brief, clear summary of your project's core idea, the problem it solves, or the value it creates.

2. **Technical Plan & Calendar**
    * A description of the practical steps (Method) and a simple timeline with key phases (Timeline).

3. **Budget & Resources**
    * An estimated budget, and a list of the physical spaces or specific tools required from Coliving Liguria.

### Two Ways to Collaborate: Defining the Legal Framework

Every project must be legally and fiscally transparent and must fit into one of the two following models:
-   **Model A: Your Independent Project (Renting Our Resources)**
    * **What it is:** You run your own project and rent resources (space, tools) from Coliving Liguria.
    * **Ownership & Profit:** The project and all profits are **100% yours**.
    * **Legal Structure:** We will sign a formal rental or service agreement.
- **Model B: A Coliving Liguria Project (You as a Contributor)**
    * **What it is:** Your idea becomes an official Coliving Liguria project, and we invest our resources to make it happen.
    * **Ownership & Profit:** Coliving Liguria will have **full ownership** of the project and any resulting profits.
    * **Your Remuneration:** Your contribution will be formally compensated, through methods like discounted accommodation, a share of the profits, or a combination of both, all detailed in a formal collaboration agreement.

When you submit your proposal, please indicate which model you envision for your project.
