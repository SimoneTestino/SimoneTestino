title: ColivingLiguria for Startups and Cofounders
---
> [!Abstract]
> I'm [[Simone Testino]], and I'm currently developing two main projects: [[ColivingLiguria]], which transforms traditional villas into vibrant hubs for remote workers and creatives, and [[Luna]], a startup focused on innovative event and industrial lighting. Coliving Liguria is designed as an ecosystem to foster new ventures. We offer space and support for co-founders for our startups, dedicated contributors, and entrepreneurs who want to develop their own projects within our environment. We provide financial and bureaucratic guidance, access to machinery and workshop space, and marketing support. As a resident, you'll also enjoy all community benefits, including access to courses and supplementary activities.

As the founder, I am actively working on building an environment that serves as a launchpad for like-minded entrepreneurs. We offer a unique opportunity to live and work in Liguria while benefiting from a structured support system. We welcome collaborators in three primary ways:

1.  **Join an existing in-house startup** (like [[Luna]]).
2.  **Contribute directly to the core [[ColivingLiguria]] project.**
3.  **Launch your own independent project** with our support.

### 1. Join Our In-House Startup: [[Luna]]

We are actively seeking co-founders and collaborators for our flagship technical startup, **[[Luna]]**, which has received funding through the [[Bando Pubblico Fesr 2021-2027. OS 1.3]]. For individuals who wish to dedicate significant skills to this project, we offer highly advantageous terms, including potentially free accommodation at Coliving Liguria.

**What is [[Luna]]?**
[[Luna]], through recently patented technologies, solves the inefficiencies of traditional light towers used on construction sites and at events. It is a large, spherical, helium-filled aerostatic balloon containing powerful LEDs. Held stable by tethers, it provides wide, diffuse, and energy-efficient illumination from a high vantage point (10-25 metres). The primary target market is high-end event lighting, with secondary applications in industry.

*We are looking for individuals with skills in engineering, electronics, and business development.*

### 2. Launch Your Own Startup From Here

If you have your own business idea, Coliving Liguria provides the ideal environment and support structure to help you bring it to life.

#### What We Offer

* **Financial & Bureaucracy Assistance:** I provide guidance on navigating Italian bureaucracy, company formation, and structuring financials for new startups in Italy. This draws from my direct experience securing European funds for [[ColivingLiguria]]. For in-depth support, see my [[Project Launch Consultancy; Funding & Bureaucracy in Italy]] services.
* **Space & Resources:** We provide office space, workshops, and accommodation. For independent projects, this operates on a model where you rent resources from Coliving Liguria.
* **Prototyping Equipment:** You will have access to high-level industrial tools, including a 3D printer, available on-site for the development of [[Luna]].
* **Marketing Support:** Leverage our network, including professional photographers and social media managers, to help promote your product or service. This aligns with our collaborative advertising model where promoting supplementary projects enhances the entire ecosystem.
* **Investment & Partnership:** For promising ideas that become official Coliving Liguria projects, we can discuss formal collaboration agreements that may include remuneration through profit sharing or other forms of equity participation in the new venture.
### 3. Community and Lifestyle Benefits
All entrepreneurs and collaborators residing at Coliving Liguria benefit from the full community experience. This includes access to all planned activities and [[Supplementary Projects]], such as language courses or sports activities, creating a balanced environment for work and life.
