> [!Abstract]
> This is an open invitation for an epic, rustic party at [[Ville Chiappella]]. This is our official **[[Winter Party in ColivingLiguria|Winter Party]]**, and we're offering **7 nights of free rent** for a full week of community, pizza parties, music, and adventure in our massive complex (currently under renovation!). The goal? To bring awesome people together, create amazing content, and promote the [[ColivingLiguria]] project.

This isn't a luxury retreat. This is an adventure. Our houses are beautiful, rustic, and **under active renovation**. This gives us the freedom to have a blast without worrying too much about the environment. We're looking for adventurous, social, and respectful people to join us for an unforgettable week.

## What's the Plan?

The week will be a mix of planned activities and spontaneous fun. The main events will be:

* **🍕 Pizza Parties:** We have a traditional wood-fired oven on-site at [[Casa del Forno]]. Our resident [[Cook]] will lead us in making proper homemade pizza, just like our weekly [[Saturday Pizza Night|Saturday Pizza Nights]], but bigger!
* **🔥 BBQ & Bonfire Night:** We'll set up a big fire outside in the garden where we can all hang out, cook, and sing.
* **🎸 Live Music:** We will have powerful speakers for music and will organize live sessions. If you can play an instrument, **definitely bring it!**
* **🍹 Cocktail Nights:** We'll set up a bar space for drinks and music.
* **🚐 Adventures:** We're located right next to the world-famous Finale Ligure outdoor area. We can also organise touristy trips to places like Portofino.

## The Offer: 7 Nights of FREE Rent

To make this happen, we're offering **one full week (7 nights) completely rent-free** in our shared sleeping places.

* **Indoor Spots (Free):** We have approximately **15 indoor sleeping places** available in *shared bedrooms*. These will be assigned on a **first-come, first-served basis** to those who complete the registration. You can organise rooms by gender or as groups of friends.
* **Tents & Vans (Free):** Our capacity is "close to unlimited" if you bring your own gear. We have over **2,000 m² of gardens** and **4,000+ m² of surrounding fields** to host tents and vans.
* **Private Rooms (Paid):** A few private bedrooms will also be available. These are **not free**, but they will be **very cheap**. They must be booked and paid for in advance.
* **Bed Linens:** Bed sheets, covers, and pillows **will be provided for free**.

## The Space & Vibe

You'll have access to the entire complex:
* Approximately **400 m²** of indoor livable spaces.
* Over **6,000 m²** of private outdoor land (gardens, fields, and woods).
* The communal outdoor kitchen with its **wood-fired oven**.

The vibe is rustic and adventurous. It will be winter (January/February), but we are in Italy and not far from the coast, so **temperatures are expected to be well above 0°C (32°F)**.

## Dates & Costs

* **Dates:** A 1-2 week period in **January or February 2026**. The exact 7-day week will be decided by a **poll in the WhatsApp group**. The final dates will be published on our [[Events Calendar]] and main [[Calendar]].
* **Accommodation:** €0 for 7 nights (in shared rooms, tents, or vans).
* **Activities:** We will share the costs for group activities. We'll keep these very low.
    * **Pizza Night:** Estimated ~€15 per person.
    * **Cocktail Night:** Estimated ~€20 per person.

## The "Not-So-Fun-But-Important" Rules

Your safety and our legal protection are paramount.
1.  **Mandatory Contract:** Every single person attending **must sign a [[Contract for Events]]** before arriving. This is a key part of the [[Event Registration]] process and will outline liability and the "Party Rules".
2.  **Security Deposit:** The contract will require a **small deposit**, which will be fully refunded if no damages are caused.
3.  **STRICTLY NO ILLEGAL DRUGS:** This is a zero-tolerance policy. Weed is illegal in Italy, and it (and any other illegal substance) is **strictly prohibited on-site**.

## How to Get Here

**Best Route:** Fly into Milan (MXP/LIN/BGY), then take a [Flixbus](https://www.flixbus.com/) to **Genoa**.
**Pickup:** **I will pick you up directly from Genoa by car**. Please coordinate your arrival time with me in the WhatsApp group.

* **[[Digital Nomads Ville Chiappella]]:** We offer a productive, budget-friendly place for remote workers with high-speed internet.
* **[[Luna]] Project:** We are also launching a tech startup, **[[Luna]]**, to build a new kind of portable illumination system. We are actively looking for **STEM-skilled students and researchers** (material science, mechatronics, software engineering) to join us as co-founders or collaborators.
