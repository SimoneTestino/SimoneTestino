>Coliving Liguria is seeking a co-founder to join its on-site team in Liguria, Italy. This is a unique opportunity for an entrepreneurial individual to shape a growing coliving business, supported by secured EU funding. We offer a highly flexible partnership, including full coverage of living expenses and a negotiable compensation package that can include a salary, profit-sharing, or equity in the properties. The role is designed to be synergistic with your own projects, remote work, or startup ideas, with the infrastructure to support them.

This document outlines the opportunity for a dedicated co-founder to join the [[ColivingLiguria]] project. We are looking for a true partner to help build, manage, and scale the entire business, leveraging our recent funding from the [[FESR Azione 1.3.3. EU Grant]] to bring our vision to life.

### The Role & Vision: A Hands-On Entrepreneur

As a co-founder, you will be a driving force behind the project, turning vision into reality. While the role requires you to be on-site, it is not conceived as a traditional full-time job for the majority of the time, allowing ample space for your own ventures.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- **Community & Operations Management:** Oversee the day-to-day life of the coliving space, manage volunteers and guests, and cultivate a vibrant, collaborative community.
- **Infrastructure & Project Development:** A core responsibility will be to lead the implementation of our planned infrastructure, making our space a hub for innovation. This includes setting up facilities for manufacturing, workshops with 3D printers, high-speed internet and server capabilities for software startups, and more. You will make sure these are not just plans, but realities.
- **Business Growth & Strategy:** Actively contribute to marketing, partnerships, and the long-term strategic direction of the project.

We strongly encourage applicants who have an existing remote job, are developing their own projects, or want to launch a startup. The ideal scenario involves a synergy where your work and [[ColivingLiguria]]'s growth are mutually beneficial.

### An Incubator for Your Venture
We want to be more than a coliving space; we aim to be a launchpad. If you have your own startup, you can use our space as a base for your team. We are prepared to adapt our buildings to your needs, whether you're in manufacturing, software development, or another field.

### A Flexible Partnership & Remuneration
This is a partnership, and the terms are open to negotiation based on your skills, experience, and what you bring to the table. We will cover your on-site living expenses (rent, food, etc.). The financial compensation is highly flexible and will be defined together. The options we can discuss include:
- A regular **fixed salary**.
- A significant share in the project's **future profits**.
- A path to **ownership of the properties** of [[ColivingLiguria]].

These are not mutually exclusive and can be combined to create a package that aligns with your long-term goals. A fixed salary is not mandatory if you prefer a structure more heavily weighted towards equity and profit-sharing.

### How to Connect
I am open to having a conversation with anyone who is seriously interested in this opportunity.
