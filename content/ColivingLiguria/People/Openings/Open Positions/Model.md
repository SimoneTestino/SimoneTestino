> [!Abstract]
> We are looking for a creative and dynamic person to become one of the faces of our community. This is a unique dual role that combines professional modeling for our in-house photography school with being a key personality on our [[Social Media]] channels, offering a unique life and work experience at [[ColivingLiguria]].

**[[ColivingLiguria]]** is a project transforming villas in the Ligurian hinterland into hubs for students, remote workers, and creatives. Our mission is to create a young, international, and collaborative environment. Our homes are hubs of activity, where residents offer courses and events, as seen in our [[Supplementary Projects]] page.
### The Dual Opportunity

We are looking for someone to collaborate with us on two complementary fronts. This is an immersive experience, so we are looking for someone who wants to move in and live with us.

1.  **Photo Model:**
    You will be the primary model for an independent photography school hosted at our facilities, which will be run by our future **[[Photographer]]** (e.g., [[Photography Course by Chris]]). You will collaborate directly with the professional photographer and their students.
2.  **Face of ColivingLiguria (Social Media):**
    You will be a principal figure on our social media channels, working in close dialogue with our **[[Social Media Manager]]**. Your role is to authentically share the story, lifestyle, and experiences of our community.

### Language Requirements
* **English:** For the social media part of the role, **good English pronunciation is mandatory**. Our content is almost exclusively in English, and part of the selection interview with **[[ColivingLiguria/People/Simone Testino]]** will be in English to assess this.
* **Italian:** Italian is a "good plus" for other projects, but **not necessary at all**. You can learn it for free on-site with our **[[Italian Classes]]**.

### Compensation & Business Models
We offer a flexible structure. Your stay will be formalised with a [[Contract for Residents]].

* **Accommodation:** We offer **free accommodation in a shared room** or a **private room at a highly reduced rent**.
* **Model 1: Core Resident**
    You can take on this role as a key community member in exchange for your accommodation.
* **Model 2: Independent Business / Profit-Sharing**
    You can structure this as your own venture under the [[Propose a Project]] framework:
    1.  **For Modeling:** You can operate with your own VAT number (Partita IVA) and create a **profit-sharing agreement directly with the [[Photographer]]** to divide the revenue from the photography school.
    2.  **For Social Media:** This is a separate arrangement. For being a key "face" of the brand, you can receive a **portion of the project's profits**, based on an agreement made directly with ColivingLiguria.

* **Free Access:** You will have **free access to all [[Supplementary Projects]]** offered at the coliving, such as languages, yoga, meditation, sports (climbing, MTB), and more.

### The Ideal Candidate
* **Age:** Indicative age is 18-30.
* **Commitment:** We are looking for someone for a long-term (18+ months) freelance contract to become a stable, recognisable face of the project. Trial periods are possible.
* **Attitude:** You have the right character for co-living: proactive, sociable, and dynamic.
* **Experience:** Previous experience as a model or SMM is appreciated, but **not necessary**.

### How to Apply
To apply, please send an email to colivingliguria@gmail.com with the following:
1.  **Motivation Letter:** Tell us who you are and why you are interested.
2.  **Aspirations & Experience:** Explain your goals and past experiences, even if unrelated.
3.  **Portfolio (Optional):** If you have one, send links or files of past work.
