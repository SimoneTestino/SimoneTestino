> [!Abstract]
> We are looking for a creative and entrepreneurial Social Media Manager to take full charge of our online presence. This is a key role that can be shaped by you, with flexible compensation ranging from free accommodation at our coliving in Italy to profit-sharing and even equity for the right long-term partner.

**[[ColivingLiguria]]** is a growing project, and our journey—transforming rustic houses at [[Ville Chiappella]] into a vibrant hub—is incredibly visual. We have a constant stream of photo and video opportunities but need a dedicated person to manage, create, and build our brand across all our [[Social Media]] channels.

We anticipate a large volume of photographic and video material that will need to be managed. We project that in the long term, a significant portion of ColivingLiguria's profits will be reinvested into marketing, meaning this team will be crucial, well-supported, and remunerated for its success.

### The Role: On-site vs. Remote

We are open to two types of collaboration:

1.  **On-Site Manager (Strongly Preferred)**
    We are primarily looking for someone who can come and live with us at [[Ville Chiappella]]. The great advantage of being on-site is having unrestricted access to capture the daily life, renovation progress, and special moments of the community. You can take photos and videos yourself, ensuring authentic and immediate content.

2.  **Remote Manager (Also Considered)**
    We will also consider proposals from highly qualified individuals who wish to manage our social media from a distance. In this model, the on-site team would provide you with raw photo and video content, and you would be responsible for editing, strategy, and management.

### Key Responsibilities
* Take full ownership of the [[ColivingLiguria]] [[Social Media]] strategy.
* Create, edit, and publish high-quality, engaging content (photos, videos, stories, reels).
* Manage the large library of visual assets from the project.
* Engage with our community, respond to messages, and foster a following.
* Develop and manage potential sponsorship or collaboration opportunities.

### Compensation & Business Model

This is not a typical 9-to-5 job; it's an opportunity to build something. The compensation is flexible and depends on your commitment and location.

* **Immediate On-Site Compensation:** For anyone joining us on-site at [[Ville Chiappella]], we offer **free accommodation** (in a private or shared room, to be agreed upon). Your residency will be formalised through a [[Contract for Residents]], ensuring a clear legal framework for your stay.

* **Business & Profit Structure:** We want you to grow with us. The model can be structured as an independent venture, similar to our [[Propose a Project]] framework:
    1.  **Independent Entrepreneur (Model A):** You can operate with your own VAT number (Partita IVA). This allows you to manage and receive income from external sponsorships or collaborations you bring in.
    2.  **Strategic Partner (Long-Term, On-Site Only):** For candidates who commit to a long-term vision and are physically present, we are open to a true partnership. This remuneration can be structured in several ways, similar to our offer for a [[Cofounder for ColivingLiguria Wanted|Cofounder]]:
        * **Direct Payments:** A share of the profits generated from your marketing efforts.
        * **Profit-Sharing:** A percentage of the project's overall future profits.
        * **Equity:** A path to ownership of ColivingLiguria's assets (the houses). This is reserved for key long-term, on-site partners.

### The Ideal Candidate
* **Language:** **Fluent English is mandatory.** Italian is appreciated, but not relevant for this role.
* **Experience:** Demonstrable experience is highly appreciated.
* **No Experience?** We also **strongly encourage applications** from motivated individuals who may not have a professional portfolio but have a great eye for content and a passion for social media.
* **Skills:** Creative, independent, skilled in photo/video capture and editing, and a good fit for a dynamic, community-focused coliving environment.
* **Location:** A strong preference for candidates willing to relocate to [[Ville Chiappella]].

### How to Apply
To apply, please send an email to colivingliguria@gmail.com with the following:
* Your CV and a motivation letter.
* **A portfolio:** This can be links to your personal social media pages, pages you manage for other businesses, or a folder of content you have created.
* Any relevant qualifications you may have.
* A brief note stating if you are applying for the on-site or remote position.
