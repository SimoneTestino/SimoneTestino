> Welcome to Coliving Liguria, a project to transform traditional properties in the Italian Riviera into vibrant hubs for remote workers, volunteers, and creative minds. This page outlines our vision, our current projects, and the many ways you can join our growing community.

Welcome to Coliving Liguria, a project born from a desire to create a unique space where productivity, community, and nature converge. Nestled in the hills of the Ligurian hinterland, just a short drive from the sea, we are transforming traditional villas and farmhouses into homes for a new generation of creators and thinkers.

### Our Projects: What We're Working On Now
#### The Heart of Coliving: Our First Villa
This is the most exciting phase of our journey. We are in the pivotal stage of finalising the acquisition of our first villa, which will become the heart of Coliving Liguria. Our ambitious goal is to have the property operational and ready to welcome our first guests by the **1st of September**. You can follow every step of this crucial stage on these pages:
* **[[House Choice]]**: See the shortlist of villas we are currently considering.
* **[[ColivingLiguria/System/Calendar]]**: Check our live calendar for the most up-to-date milestones and key dates.

#### We're Expanding: Property Partnerships
As our project grows, we are actively looking for new properties to bring into the Coliving Liguria family. We specialise in taking on rustic farmhouses (`cascine`) to renovate and manage through a partnership model. If you own a property in the Ligurian hinterland and are interested in a hands-off way to bring it to life, learn more on our page about the [[Diventa Partner di Coliving Liguria|Property Partnership Programme]] (Note: Our website is bilingual, but this page is currently available in Italian only).
#### Do you want to do the same by yourself? Project Launch Consultancy
Drawing from our direct experience in securing EU funding and navigating Italian bureaucracy, we also help other aspiring entrepreneurs. We offer [[Project Launch Consultancy; Funding & Bureaucracy in Italy|consultancy services]] to guide you through the process of launching your own project in Italy.
### The Vision: Life at the Villa
Our goal is to create an environment that balances focused work with a strong sense of community and a connection to the stunning Italian landscape. Our properties will offer:
* **Private rooms** for personal space and quiet time.
* Spacious **shared areas**, including a large kitchen, comfortable living rooms, and dedicated co-working spaces.
* **High-speed internet** as a top priority, ensuring a seamless remote work experience.
* A welcoming atmosphere for **pets** and ample space for those travelling with **camper vans**.
