> This page outlines the application process for students from **non-EU universities** who wish to conduct a **Curricular Internship** at [[ColivingLiguria]] or [[Luna]]. This process is legally complex and requires a visa, an accredited Italian intermediary, and careful planning.

### Our Internship Philosophy
We believe in providing real-world educational experiences. Our internships are structured as **curricular traineeships**, meaning they are part of your official university studies and are designed to provide you with academic credits (ECTS).

This process is built upon a formal, triangular legal agreement between you (the Student), an accredited Italian Promoting Body, and us (the Host Organisation).

### The Legal Framework for Non-EU Internships
This path is significantly more complex than the one for EU students. You must be aware of two major legal requirements:

1.  **Visa Requirement:** You will require a specific **visa (e.g., for study or internship)** to enter and stay in Italy legally. You must apply for this at the Italian Consulate in your home country *well in advance*.
2.  **Accredited Promoting Body (Soggetto Promotore):** Under Italian law, your home university (e.g., in the USA, UK, Canada, or Asia) **cannot** legally activate an internship in Italy. You **must** use an **accredited Italian intermediary** (an 'ente promotore'). This can be a foundation, an agency, or a partner university in Italy that is legally accredited to manage internships.

It is **your sole responsibility** to find, contact, and manage the relationship with this Italian intermediary. We (the Host Organisation) cannot do this for you.

### How to Apply

#### Initial Contact
Your first step is to send a formal application email to [colivingliguria@gmail.com](mailto:colivingliguria@gmail.com). This email **must** include two mandatory attachments:
* **Your full Curriculum Vitae (CV)**
* **A copy of your valid Passport**

In the email, please also briefly state your motivation and which project ([[ColivingLiguria]] or [[Luna]]) you are interested in.

#### The Interview
If your profile matches our needs, we will invite you to schedule a video call with the founder, [[ColivingLiguria/People/Simone Testino]], to discuss your motivation, skills, and the specifics of the potential traineeship.

### The Activation Process (After the Interview)
If the interview is successful, the official legal process begins. This is what you must do:

1.  **Find Your Italian Intermediary:** You must find an Italian 'Soggetto Promotore' accredited to manage internships for non-EU citizens.
2.  **Provide Us Their Contact:** You must provide us with the official email address of your chosen Italian intermediary.
3.  **We Sign the 'Convenzione':** The founder will send the *Convenzione* (Framework Agreement) from the official certified email ([simone.testino@legalmail.it](mailto:simone.testino@legalmail.it)) to your intermediary. This is the master legal agreement between our company and them.
4.  **Develop the 'Progetto Formativo Individuale' (PFI):** Working with us and your intermediary, you will develop the PFI (Individual Training Plan). This document details your learning objectives and activities.

### Mandatory Obligations: Insurance and Visa
The PFI and Convenzione are the essential documents you will need for your visa application.

* **Insurance (INAIL & RC):** The Italian intermediary is legally responsible for ensuring you have mandatory **INAIL** (Workplace Accident Insurance) and **RC** (Third-Party Liability Insurance) coverage.
* **Administrative Costs:** The intermediary will charge fees for their service and for the cost of these insurance policies. These costs are **your responsibility** (or your home university's). The Host Organisation does not cover these administrative fees.
* **Visa Application:** Once all documents are signed, **you** must use them to apply for the correct visa at your local Italian Consulate. This process can take several months, so you must start immediately. You can seek help by consulting the page [[Visa Assistance Policy]] or pay for the [[Premium Visa Assistance]].

### Costs and Residency
As this is a formal curricular traineeship (not employment), there is no salary.
* **Accommodation Contribution:** You will be required to pay a weekly contribution of **€30 to €50**. This covers your accommodation and utilities.
* **Food:** Food is **not** included in this contribution, as will be specified in your residency contract.
* **Residency Contract:** You will be required to sign the standard [[Contract for Residents]]. All specific contracts and templates (including the PFI) are collected in our [[Contract for Internship]] policy page.

### Final Step: Onboarding
**After** all the paperwork is signed (Convenzione, PFI) and, most importantly, **your visa has been approved and issued**, you will be officially accepted.

From that point, you will proceed with the standard [[Onboarding]] process to be formally enrolled as a resident. This internship procedure must be completed *before* the standard onboarding begins.

### Legal Reference
This process is built on specific Italian and regional laws. For a detailed breakdown of the legal obligations, please refer to our internal notes: [[Internships Curriculari in Liguria]].
