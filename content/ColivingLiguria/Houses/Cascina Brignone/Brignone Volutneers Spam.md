Hi everyone,

Just wanted to share some initial, very exciting news about the first potential property for our project!

I'm meeting with the current owners and their financial advisor on Wednesday the 24th to sort out all the details for the acquisition. They've already offered the house at a really generous price to help support the project, which is fantastic.

This place is going to need a lot of love and renovation, so dedicated volunteers will be needed more than ever! The work will be led by a mix of myself, other volunteers with relevant skills, and professionals where required.

You can find all the details about the house, what we're offering volunteers, and what to expect on this page:

If you have any questions after reading, feel free to drop me a DM. For anyone who is keen to join, we can schedule a call in the next few days to have a chat and see how our availabilities line up.

**A quick heads-up on the timeline:** The house isn't officially ours just yet. The meeting on the 24th is to get everything clear and agreed upon. I'll only be able to give a firm confirmation once a contract is signed and I have the keys, which is likely to happen 1-2 weeks after that. That's when we can officially have people over and start the volunteering opportunities.

I'm sending this message now to get a clearer picture of who is interested in joining right from the very beginning, which we're hoping will be in early October.

Before asking general questions about the house (and its videos), the volunteer offer, food, location, etc., please have first a good read through the link and the connected pages.

Cheers everyone, and let's keep our fingers crossed that it all goes well with this property! 🤞
