Hey everyone, some initial news about the first property for the project. I am meeting up with the current owners and their financial advisor on Wednesday 24th in order to define all details for the acquisition, they already offered the house at a very generous price to substain the project. This property is going to require a lot of renovation so volunteers are going to be needed more than ever! To lead the renovation there will be sometimes me, other volutneers that have skills in that field or professionals when needed.
