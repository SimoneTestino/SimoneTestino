# Plan for the First Days

A prioritised to-do list for the initial move-in and setup at [[Ville Chiappella]].

### Priority 1: Immediate Tasks (Day 1)
*These are the essentials for establishing a personal base and getting critical services started.*

* **Secure Your Own Room**
    * **Task:** Choose a personal room.
    * **Detail:** Per your note, select a cellar (`cantina`) to keep the main bedrooms free for [[Volunteers]]. This is marked "da fare ora" (do it now).
* **Activate Critical Utilities**
    * **Task:** Start the activation process for water and electricity.
    * **Details:**
        * **Electricity:** Begin the process (see [[Attivazione Luce]]).
        * **Water:** Research the provider ("da ricercare") and make contact.
    * **Time:** These calls are a Day 1 action, but activation may take several days.

### Priority 2: Critical Triage (Day 1)
*Assessments to ensure basic habitability for the first team.*

* **Assess Bathroom Functionality**
    * **Task:** Find and confirm at least one functioning bathroom.
    * **Detail:** Check that a toilet flushes and a sink works (once water is on).
* **Assess Kitchen & Heating**
    * **Task:** Check for a viable kitchen space and a working heat source.
    * **Detail:** Confirm the status of the wood-burning stove ("stufa a legna"). This is essential for November.

### Priority 3: Ongoing Tasks (Start Day 1-2)
*The main "work" that needs to begin as soon as your base is set.*

* **Start Clearing Rubbish ("Rumenta")**
    * **Task:** Begin clearing out all unwanted items and rubbish from the houses.
    * **Detail:** Start with the areas needed first: kitchen, bathroom, and volunteer rooms.
* **Sort Waste Concurrently**
    * **Task:** As you clear, sort all items into the defined categories.
    * **Categories:**
        1.  Recoverable Items
        2.  Rubbish for Disposal
        3.  Firewood ("Legna da ardere")

### Priority 4: Lower Priority (As Time Permits)
*Important tasks to be done after immediate habitability is secured.*

* **Take Measurements for Fusion360**
    * **Task:** Start taking detailed measurements of the rooms and spaces.
    * **Detail:** This is less urgent ("con meno priorita"). It can be done as rooms are cleared.
