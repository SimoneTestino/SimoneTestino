# Volunteers Wanted for ColivingLiguria's First House! 🏡✨

  

After a lot of planning, we're thrilled to announce that we're moving forward with our very first property! We are finally getting started and couldn't be more excited.

  

For those who are new here, ColivingLiguria is a project creating a vibrant coliving community for ****remote workers**** and creatives here in beautiful Liguria, Italy. 🇮🇹 We're nestled right between the mountains and the coast, offering the best of both worlds!

  

To kick things off, we're looking for a handful (5-10) of ****adventurous volunteers**** to join us for the foundational stage. This is a hands-on opportunity to help with the initial renovation and shape our community from the very beginning. Availability is expected to start in early October.

  

Curious about the details? On our website, you'll find everything you need to know:

  

- A complete video tour of the house in its current state

- Our offer (accommodation, community life, pet policy 🐾)

- What we expect in return (renovation help, community tasks)

- The precise location on Google Maps (we're 10 mins from a train station & 30 mins from the beach!)

  

You can find the full info page right here:
