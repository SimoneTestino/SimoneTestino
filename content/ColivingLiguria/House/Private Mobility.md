> This page outlines the mobility strategy for Coliving Liguria. Our long-term vision is to provide a sustainable and convenient transport fleet for our residents, including a 4x4 vehicle and electric scooters. This document also details our immediate plan to acquire a first-response vehicle to ensure autonomy from the very beginning of the project.

### Our Long-Term Mobility Vision
A key part of the Coliving Liguria experience is providing residents with the freedom to explore the stunning surroundings, from the coast to the mountains. Our long-term plan is to have a dedicated fleet of vehicles available for the community. This will include a robust 4x4 car—which could be hybrid, electric, or petrol—for group trips and transporting larger items.

The core of our daily transport will be a fleet of electric scooters, sufficient for all residents to move around independently. A crucial aspect of our model is that the use and charging of these electric scooters will be included in the cost of the stay, with no extra fees for our community members.

### The First Step: An Initial Petrol Scooter
While our final goal is a sustainable electric fleet, our immediate priority is to ensure operational autonomy from day one. We cannot be dependent on others for essential travel. Therefore, the very first vehicle we will acquire is a reliable, used 125cc petrol scooter. This will allow us to manage initial errands, project logistics, and offer a transport solution while we build up our permanent fleet.

To make the right choice for this first crucial purchase, we are currently evaluating two options. The decision will be based on a balance of aesthetics, reliability, and price, after negotiation with both sellers. Acquiring one of these is a critical step that will be taken as soon as we have a signed agreement for a house, as without it, we would be unable to move forward effectively.
