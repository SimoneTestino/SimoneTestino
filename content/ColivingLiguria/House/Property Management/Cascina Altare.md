It is crucial to note that, as of the date of this document, we do not own this property. Our path to potential ownership is a structured, multi-phase programme. This process is governed by the legal agreements detailed below, starting with a temporary 'loan-for-use' agreement that allows us to prepare a comprehensive renovation project before committing to a long-term contract.

## Location and Context

* **Address:** Località isola del Pero, 80, Altare
* **Property Map:** [https://maps.app.goo.gl/N4ndu2cxLrVTQWCA6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/N4ndu2cxLrVTQWCA6)
* **Nearest 4G+ Mast Map:** [https://lteitaly.it/it/public/map.php#16/44.336478/8.3345589](https://lteitaly.it/it/public/map.php#16/44.336478/8.3345589)
* **Start of Dirt Track:** [https://maps.app.goo.gl/42rKWcoiX612PSxD9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/42rKWcoiX612PSxD9)

### Property Access
The property is reached via a simple dirt road of approximately 300m. With some effort to make it more suitable, it appears passable by car or camper van.

### Internet Speed Estimate
Initial tests show speeds slightly under 100 Mbps via a standard cellular line. This could likely be improved by installing a more efficient external antenna for the 5G network.

## Legal and Financials

### Land Registry Information (`Catasto`)
The property appears to be composed of two legally distinct apartments, with a single external staircase leading to the first floor.

Initial analysis of the land registry map (`mappali`) suggests the property includes the following parcels:
* **House and surroundings:** 547
* **Vehicle Access:** 211
* **Adjacent Land:** 205, 204, 299, 14
* **Woods Above:** 300
* **Vegetable Garden (`orto`):** 17
* **Status Unclear:** It is yet to be confirmed if parcel 16 is included in the property.

### Agreements
> [!Note] Temporary Loan-for-Use Agreement
> A temporary `comodato` agreement, conceptually similar to [[Fac Simile Comodato.pdf]], will be used.

> [!Note] Definitive Agreement (Rent-to-Own / Management)
> *This space is dedicated to the future definitive agreement, which will govern the long-term partnership.*

## Property and Structure Description

* **Type:** Portion of a rural house (`porzione di casa rurale`) made of concrete.
* **Layout:** The house is divided into at least three sections. The ground floor is further subdivided.
* **External Structures:** Includes a large courtyard with a wood-fired brick oven, suitable for parking.
* **Land Area:** Large plot of cultivable land and forest.

### Current State
* **Structure:** The roof appears to be in good condition. The exterior of the house requires significant renovation.
* **First Floor:** In good condition considering the context. It requires thorough cleaning and reorganisation. The plaster needs partial repairs before the walls are painted, but the essentials are in place.
* **Ground Floor:** Requires more substantial renovation. Most of the plaster needs to be redone and the walls painted. The bathroom is in decent condition but the plumbing system will need to be checked after cleaning.
* **Garden:** Requires significant work.

## Project and Works

### Project Strategy & Timeline
Our acquisition strategy is a rent-to-buy programme, as it is unlikely that the multiple co-owners will fund the renovation. We will finance the works ourselves in exchange for future ownership.

* **By 16th August:** Sign the temporary 'loan-for-use' (`comodato`) agreement.
* **By 31st August:** During the initial `comodato` period, we will:
    1.  Have the property professionally valued.
    2.  Draft the definitive long-term acquisition contract (rent-to-buy).
    3.  Finalise plans with long-term volunteers who intend to stay at the property.
* **Post 31st August:** Based on the valuation and project plan, we will make a formal rent-to-buy offer. The payment structure will likely be a fixed rate or profit-based payments (e.g., every 6 months) until an agreed-upon threshold is met.

### Renovation Plan
* **By End of October:** Complete the renovation of the house exterior.
* **During Winter:** Complete the interior renovations.
* **Note:** A more detailed project plan will be developed by Parisa and shared here once complete.
