# Property Sheet: Cascina in Altare

## Project and Works

### Prerequisites and Immediate Actions
Before any work can begin, the following steps must be completed:
1.  **Sign the Loan-for-Use Agreement:** Formalise the temporary agreement with the owners.
2.  **Key Handover:** Obtain full access to the property.
3.  **Check Equipment:** Establish with the owners which tools, if any, will be provided on loan.
4.  **Procure Materials:** Begin purchasing the necessary materials for the initial works.

### Initial Works (Loan-for-Use Phase)
The goal of this phase is not the full renovation, but to make one room habitable in order to work on the definitive project. The authorised works, to be carried out in accordance with [[Edilizia Libera|Permit-Free Works]] regulations, are:
* **Clearing Out:** Completely empty a designated room.
* **Masonry and Finishes:** Remove and redo plaster, sand and treat any wooden beams or ceilings.
* **Minimal Systems:** Restore bathroom plumbing and connect to the electrical system for tools and basic lighting.
* **Fixtures:** Replace the room's door and window as needed.
* **Finishing Touches:** General cleaning of the work area.
