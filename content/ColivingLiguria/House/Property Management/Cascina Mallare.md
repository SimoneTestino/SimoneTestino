 This document serves as the private, central hub for all information, documents, and plans related to this property.

It is crucial to note that, as of the date of this document, we do not own this property. Our path to potential ownership is a structured, multi-phase programme. This process is governed by the legal agreements detailed below, starting with a temporary 'loan-for-use' agreement that allows us to prepare a comprehensive renovation project before committing to a long-term contract.

## Location and Context

* **Address:** Via acque, 31, Mallare, Savona
* **Property Map:** [https://maps.app.goo.gl/tmKpQavV78MBoaoB9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tmKpQavV78MBoaoB9)
* **Nearest 4G+ Mast Map:** [https://lteitaly.it/it/public/map.php#18/44.319478/8.3388054](https://lteitaly.it/it/public/map.php#18/44.319478/8.3388054)
* **Start of Dirt Track:** [https://maps.app.goo.gl/i7cSqJhVgviNUbay5](https://maps.app.goo.gl/i7cSqJhVgviNUbay5)
### Property Access
The property is reached via a private, 700-metre dirt track through the woods. The listing notes that access currently requires a 4x4 vehicle but that the road is scheduled to be improved shortly. This logistical aspect is a key factor for planning the transport of materials.
### Internet Speed Estimate
Considering the nearest mast is a **4G+** type, located approximately **2 km away with a clear line of sight**, the signal quality is expected to be excellent. With a good quality 4G+ router, it is reasonable to expect speeds between **80-150 Mbps for download** and **20-50 Mbps for upload**, which is more than sufficient for remote work.

## Property and Structure Description
* **Type:** Farmhouse / Rustic Stone House (`Casale/cascina`)
* **Surface Area:** 350 sqm
* **Land Area:** Approx. 50,000 sqm (5 hectares) of surrounding land, mainly chestnut forest and sunny terraces.

* **Utilities:** Electricity is connected. A private, perennial water spring is present on the property.
## Project and Works
### Prerequisites and Immediate Actions
Before any work can begin, the following steps must be completed:
1.  **Sign the Loan-for-Use Agreement:** Formalise the temporary agreement with the owners.
2.  **Key Handover:** Obtain full access to the property.
3.  **Check Equipment:** Establish with the owners, within 48 hours of signing, which tools (drill, sander, etc.) will be provided on loan and which will need to be purchased.
4.  **Procure Materials:** Begin purchasing materials or await their delivery from the owners by the 15th of August.
### Initial Works (Loan-for-Use Phase - until 31st August)
The goal of this phase is not the full renovation, but to make one room habitable in order to work on the definitive project. The authorised works, to be carried out in accordance with [[Edilizia Libera|Permit-Free Works]] regulations, are:
* **Clearing Out:** Completely empty "Room 1".
* **Masonry and Finishes:** Remove and redo the plaster in Room 1. Sand and apply resin to the underside of the ceiling slab.
* **Minimal Systems:** Restore bathroom plumbing and connect to the electrical system for tools and basic lighting in Room 1.
* **Fixtures:** Replace the room's door and window.
* **Finishing Touches:** General cleaning of the work area.
