> This document outlines the current state, project plans, and potential of the property located in [Roccavignale]([https://maps.app.goo.gl/VTKgFWRAoTDuBJE3A](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VTKgFWRAoTDuBJE3A)). The house is a recently renovated structure requiring only finishing works. The project is managed under the [[ColivingLiguria]] initiative, with the goal of establishing a long-term [[Diventa Partner di Coliving Liguria|Partnership]] or rent-to-buy agreement with the owners.
### Description of the House and Terrains
The property is a recently renovated concrete house, meaning the roof and core structure are in perfect condition. The electrical system and the main hydraulic system (water inlet and drainage) are fully functional. The interior, however, is a blank canvas, currently lacking flooring and all bathroom fixtures (WC, shower).

The property includes two separate plots of land. Directly in front of the house is a **1,000 m² garden** with numerous mature chestnut trees. This space is not only a pleasant recreational area but also offers the opportunity to learn and use traditional local recipes involving chestnuts. Approximately 300 metres away, and accessible by car, is a second, mostly flat plot of land of **3,000 m²**.

Pictures and videos of the house are going to be available only after the owner signs the contract. 

Internet connectivity at the house will be provided via the mobile network. The property benefits from excellent coverage, with four nearby antennas from all major Italian operators. The closest masts are [this one (covering TIM, WindTre, Iliad)](https://lteitaly.it/it/public/map.php#16/44.356662/8.1736049) and a slightly more distant [Vodafone mast](https://lteitaly.it/it/public/map.php#16/44.360981/8.1723260). By using a high-quality 4G/5G router with an external antenna, we expect to achieve a stable and constant speed of around **200 Mbps**.
### Project and Works
Our plan is to complete the interior to create a high-quality living space. The initial design, which is still subject to detailed planning by Parisa, envisions two double master bedrooms, each with its own private bathroom, and a particularly large communal kitchen. The house will also be equipped with underfloor heating.
#### Initial Living Conditions (First Weeks/Month)
For the initial phase, living conditions will be basic. The water from the external tap is drinkable and working. A temporary shower and WC will be set up outside. As there is no active electricity contract, we will rely on [solar panels](https://www.amazon.it/-/en/Mesuvida-Portable-Charger-Foldable-Camping/dp/B0CSFWSQMX/ref=sr_1_6?crid=3MK1UJWI8EUKS&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.htgX0tCvjxqiJFukTAD5TE0-uUR7m1zyWCQeHgBrk7BPokzhF2a_hLTxeHDOp-w2In_odO3MRNZvxQ1drQMb_POxdr-V4MYMhWpTbIqHon80K4Lx7p_UmLL1gQHVKoygMxcOy-jkAINw9ipNbfcqOZx947hFLkivAhlvKovc8tcpcXqOwBCHt2oHUNpEMVtJro8HV2dZweBWhZLpYuBZDSDlCWTROXCEaUCDcRMd_NzNIyV3THHskduXDFzEeG9mBJUu5T7gj-sT2O39Wk6vqcFLjxC0OPInzK9R9DQyJ8c.nMxkiu-UVMrhkaz6bbIX_T7YB8YN58oUUkJKnfJ38b0&dib_tag=se&keywords=Solar%2Bcharger%2B60W&qid=1755456567&sprefix=solar%2Bcharger%2B60w%2Caps%2C115&sr=8-6&th=1) to charge essential devices like laptops and phones.

#### Long-Term Project Options
We are currently considering two main strategic options for the property:

* **Option 1: Two Master Bedrooms with Private Bathrooms**
    This plan focuses on creating a premium internal living space, with two large master bedrooms each having an en-suite bathroom. This would be the standard configuration for the autumn and winter months.

* **Option 2: Seasonal Camping & Flexible Space**
    This option involves using the 1,000 m² front garden as a small, exclusive camping area during the spring and summer months. To facilitate this, one of the two bathrooms would be made available to the campers. This would mean that during the high season, one of the master bedrooms would lose its private bathroom. Alternatively, we could explore converting one of the three cellars (`cantine`) into dedicated bathrooms for the campsite, pending a review of local regulations.

>Hello everyone!! 🏡 Things are starting to move…! We may have the first signature for our new villa this Tuesday, let’s see! 🤞
>
>So, I want to start making a plan for who could be coming and when. For anyone interested in joining this week or the upcoming one, please text me in a private message.
>
>A bit about the place: it's a recently renovated house in Roccavignale, Savona. The main structure is clean and ready, but it's missing the final touches (bathroom, kitchen, and flooring). Our mission for the first month will be to get it ready! This will involve a fair bit of cleaning in the adjacent rooms, a lot of gardening (we have 1,000m² of garden with many chestnut trees, plus a 3,000m² field!), and setting up a working shower and WC. 🚿
>
>This is a unique chance to be involved from the very beginning. You'll also be able to take part in the financial/contractual side of things I'll be working on, and the design/renovation plan directed by our professional interior designer, Paris@⁨Parisa Kalantari⁩.
>
>The expected work time is 6 hours per day by default (3 in the morning, 3 in the afternoon), with a precise schedule to be confirmed. As a special exception, because their contribution is particularly valuable for this initial phase, the Garden Planning Expert, Plumber, and Car Owner roles can work half the time (3 hours per day).
>
>To make this happen, we're looking for people with a few different skills:
>
>•⁠  ⁠🧹 Gardening & Cleaning Crew: People who are happy to get their hands dirty with general cleaning and bringing the large garden back to life!
>
>•  ⁠🌳 Garden Planning Expert: This is a key role! We're looking for someone with experience or certified skills in garden planning, garden design, or relevant biology. Specific knowledge of chestnut trees would be incredible.
>
>•⁠  ⁠🔧 Plumber / Bathroom Renovator: One of the most skillful roles we need! We're looking for someone who can handle the hydraulic planning for the house and renovate a bathroom.
>
>•⁠  ⁠📸 Content Creator: We need someone to handle photography, videomaking, and social media management to document our journey and post updates on the Instagram page.
>
>•⁠  ⁠🚗 Car Owner: If you come with your own car and are willing to make it available for project use.
>
>A few things to know about the living situation for the first month: rooms are likely to be shared, though we can arrange same-gender rooms on request. We might be able to offer private rooms after this initial start-up phase. We'll provide air mattresses with clean sheets, pillows, and towels – you just need to bring your own clothes. Please be aware that we will likely not have warm water for the first month (refreshing showers are a pleasure given the temperature anyway!), but we will have solar panels for electricity to charge laptops and phones. ⚡
>
>Regarding food, expenses will be shared and are not covered. You can either arrange meals privately or join in with what we all buy for ourselves. Things will be very simple and cheap at the beginning as we won't have a kitchen set up yet.
>
>For transport, you can get a train to Cairo Montenotte (much better!) or Savona. In exceptional cases, I might be able to pick you up from Genoa by car.
>
>The minimum stay is 3 nights, and the maximum confirmable stay is 1 month. We'd love to extend this for people who work well with us and whose skills will be useful in the future.
>
>If you have any questions or are interested in this very early opportunity, please send me a message! ✨
