You can make an idea yourself of this villa by looking at the [Listing]( https://www.idealista.it/immobile/31608509/).
### Property Overview and Potential
By face value, this property is a fantastic option, primarily due to its sheer size and excellent overall condition. It offers the potential for up to 15 bedrooms on the main floors, not including an attic space that could be converted into two or three more. The house is built from modern concrete and steel, with the ground floor constructed in the 1950s and the first floor expanded in the 1970s, making it a more robust structure than the traditional stone houses common in the region. The interiors are impressive, featuring recently renovated bathrooms and a practical layout with a bathroom on each floor, good stairs, and a garage that could easily be transformed into a workshop or laboratory.

The setting is another major draw, with the Bormida river running directly alongside the grounds. This provides access to a natural riverside beach, perfect for recreation and cooling off, and offers a sustainable water source for a potential swimming pool or natural pond. The property includes a large, flat, and fenced front garden, as well as terrain that extends down to the river, offering ample space for outdoor activities year-round.

Two additional structures enhance the property's potential. The first is a beautifully crafted wooden house, built by the previous owners who were woodworkers, which stays cool even in summer; it could serve as a unique guest cabin or an "upgraded tent." The second is a large covered entrance area (*porticato*) that could be enclosed with removable glass panels. This would create a versatile, all-season external kitchen, maximising the number of private bedrooms within the main house. Finally, a small 4x2 metre cellar (*cantina*) on the ground floor is perfectly positioned to be converted into a sauna with a river view. The property is located 44 minutes from the sea, and we plan to include private transport options in the price of the stay.

### An Optimal Location for All Four Seasons

The property's strategic location offers a unique advantage, providing a perfect base for year-round activities that blend nature, sport, and relaxation.

#### Summer: Rivers and Riviera
During the summer, the adjacent Bormida river offers a private oasis with its own natural beach, providing refreshing cool water perfect for relaxing in the shade. For those seeking the classic Italian beach experience, the vibrant coastal town of [Loano and the Ligurian Riviera are just a 44-minute drive away](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Regione+Bosco,+3,+17057+Calizzano+SV/Loano,+Province+of+Savona/@44.176209,8.1296674,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x12d28d26c70d60bd:0x5908396e6a774742!2m2!1d8.1183669!2d44.227494!1m5!1m1!1s0x12d2f65b0a39b1e3:0xe18091fad258f181!2m2!1d8.2558714!2d44.1261565!3e0!5m1!1e4?entry=ttu).

#### Autumn & Spring: World-Class Outdoor Sports
The villa is situated at the doorstep of the [Finale Outdoor Region](https://www.finaleoutdoor.com/en), a globally renowned destination for adventure sports, making it ideal for the milder seasons. This area is the epicentre of Enduro mountain biking, hosting stages of the [UCI Mountain Bike World Cup](https://www.finaleoutdoor.com/it/whoop-uci-mountain-bike-world-series-uci-enduro-world-cup-finale-outdoor-region), and is famous for its incredible rock climbing spots. From hiking to expert-level extreme sports, the region offers endless possibilities, with the main activity centres in Finale Ligure just 15 to 45 minutes away.

#### Winter: Skiing and Mountain Escapes
In winter, the location provides excellent access to the mountains. The charming resort town of [San Giacomo di Roburent is only an hour's drive](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Regione+Bosco,+3,+17057+Calizzano+SV/San+Giacomo+di+Roburent,+Province+of+Cuneo/@44.3054106,7.8775987,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x12d28d26c70d60bd:0x5908396e6a774742!2m2!1d8.1183669!2d44.227494!1m5!1m1!1s0x12d29b5ec90c0bfb:0x1586df19f4a54afa!2m2!1d7.8741555!2d44.2951012!3e0!5m1!1e4?entry=ttu), while the popular ski resorts of [Prato Nevoso and Artesina](https://pratonevoso.com/home-inverno/) are [less than 90 minutes away](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Regione+Bosco,+3,+17057+Calizzano+SV/Prato+Nevoso,+Province+of+Cuneo/@44.3265693,7.7779852,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x12d28d26c70d60bd:0x5908396e6a774742!2m2!1d8.1183669!2d44.227494!1m5!1m1!1s0x12d28282bbf997ab:0xa05e67fd6b2c930!2m2!1d7.7846517!2d44.2546181!3e0!5m1!1e4?entry=ttu), offering fantastic skiing and winter sports opportunities.

To ensure easy access to all these locations, we will offer private transport options, including 125cc-equivalent e-scooters. Additionally, a public transport stop is conveniently located right next to the house. More details on all transport options will be shared soon on our [WhatsApp Community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/J67Cds7idarLwZrJRNywQS?mode=ac_t) and [@colivingliguria Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/colivingliguria/) page.
### Identified Challenges and Mitigations
The property's primary challenge is its location next to a provincial road (*strada provinciale*), which is busy and creates considerable noise during the day. However, the house itself is exceptionally well-insulated with two sets of double-glazed windows, ensuring the interior remains completely quiet. To maintain comfort during the summer without opening windows, we plan to install an efficient air circulation system, likely as part of our [[Smart Home]] project. Furthermore, while the upper garden is exposed to the road noise, the main recreational area is planned for the lower garden near the river, which is shielded from the sound by its elevation.

The adjacent river also presents a potential flood risk, but after examination, we consider this to be manageable. The house has a proven history of withstanding severe floods without damage, and its location and elevation are consistent with the rest of the village. The concrete foundations provide a significant structural advantage over traditional stone houses in the area, leading us to believe it is not a major threat.
### Outstanding Issues and Next Steps
There are several outstanding questions that must be answered before we can proceed. The primary issue concerns an outstanding building permit (*pratica edilizia*) that is reportedly in the process of being closed, with a forecasted completion by the end of September. This timeline is critical, as the purchase is dependent on funding from the [[Bando Pubblico Fesr 2021-2027. OS 1.3]]. It remains to be established:

1.  Can we be provided with all documents and details of the work that needs to be completed, so our technician can review them? This is a priority, as we need to independently verify that the timeline is realistic and assess any risk of the property ultimately failing to achieve compliance. We cannot risk losing two months of operativity on a property that may be ineligible.

2.  A fractioning of the land parcels also needs to be completed. Will this be done within the same timeframe? Is 4.000 m$^2$ the size of the garden before or after the fractioning?

Another bureaucratic matter to be addressed is the access road:

3.  We were told there is a communal road providing vehicle access to the lower terrain, but that this may be removed following an agreement with the *Comune*. Can we receive the documentation for this agreement? We need to know definitively if we will have vehicle access to that part of the property and whether we are permitted to fence it, which would not be possible if an official road runs through it.

Furthermore, we require the following:

4.  A formal technical analysis of the risks from the river, providing a clear, quantitative understanding of the probabilities of various flood scenarios.

5.  Access to view the detached storage room, which we have not yet been able to see. 

Additionally, we would like to ask:

6.  Once the preliminary purchase agreement (*proposta d'acquisto*) is signed, can we have access to the house before the final payment is made? This access would be solely for planning and organisational purposes, not for residency.

Finally, once all these questions have been addressed:

7.  How should we proceed with the *proposta d'acquisto*? We can either draft our own or begin by editing a version you provide. Given the risks outlined above, it is essential for us that the contract includes clauses to protect us from delays and from the possibility of the house ultimately being non-compliant with the rules of the [[Bando Pubblico Fesr 2021-2027. OS 1.3]].
