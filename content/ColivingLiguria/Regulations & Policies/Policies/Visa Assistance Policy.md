> This page outlines our position on visa assistance. In short: **we do not offer visa sponsorship or employment contracts**. Please do not contact us via WhatsApp or Instagram regarding visa enquiries if you do not already have one. The only way to propose a visa path is via a complete email application, as detailed below. This page explains the only potential, complex, and applicant-driven path that may exist.

### A Note on Visas: Our Legal Framework

Welcome to ColivingLiguria. We understand that navigating entry to Italy for non-EU citizens is complex, so we wish to be exceptionally clear from the outset.

We are a project based on partnership and residency, not traditional employment. All our residents, regardless of their contribution, sign a [[Contract for Residents]], which is a legally registered `Contratto di Locazione` (Lease Agreement). This document establishes you as a tenant, not an employee, and as such, it is **not** a valid basis for a visa application, to our knowledge.

We **do not** offer employment contracts, nor can we use "volunteer" status for legal entry, as detailed in our [[Limiti Legali del Volontariato|Legal Boundaries of Volunteering]] policy.

### The Only Potential Path: A Self-Employed Partnership

Whilst we do not offer jobs, many of our [[Openings]] (such as [[Farmer]], [[Mountain Bike Guide & Trail Designer]], or [[Italian Teacher]]) are designed as independent business opportunities. This is where a potential, though "borderline," case may exist.

This path would involve you moving to Italy on a self-employment visa, opening your own Italian `Partita IVA` (VAT/sole trader registration), and operating your project as an independent partner of ColivingLiguria. We could provide a partnership contract that details your residency (your bedroom) and outlines the framework for you to generate your own income through your affiliated project.

This *might* be a viable basis for a visa, but it is **your** responsibility to research it.

Please understand that I, the founder, am managing many aspects of this project, and navigating this complex legal path is very far from being a priority of mine. However, if *you* have the motivation, time, and competence to devote to it, it is realistic that you could get here in this way.

You have all the resources on this website to know what I can offer, and the internet provides all you need to find out what is required to get a visa from the Italian authorities. You must research Italian immigration law (e.g., `Testo Unico sull'Immigrazione`, precedents from the `Corte di Cassazione`, or requirements in the `Codice Civile`) and come to me with a complete, viable plan.

### How to Apply: The Formal Visa Proposal

We receive a high volume of enquiries daily. For this reason, **only perfect and complete applications that follow every instruction will be considered.**

If you believe you have a viable legal path, you must send a single, complete application via email.

* **To:** colivingliguria@gmail.com
* **Subject:** `Visa Assistance Request - Complete Application`

Do not contact us on WhatsApp or Instagram before sending this, or to ask "how" to do it. You may only contact us *after* the email is sent, or for a rapid clarification if absolutely necessary.

Your application email **must** attach all of the following documents in **PDF format**. If even one document is missing, your application will be automatically discarded.

#### Application Checklist (All files as PDF):

1.  **The Legal Proposal (PDF):** A formal document, based on verifiable Italian legal sources, that clearly outlines the specific visa path you are proposing (e.g., self-employment). It must state *exactly* what documentation you require from me (e.g., a specific clause in our partnership contract).
2.  **Consulate CC:** You **must** CC your nearest Italian Consulate/Embassy on the email. This is for transparency, so they can verify your proposed legal basis is sensible. (Attaching a written statement from an Italian lawyer certifying your proposal is highly advantageous).
3.  **Your Full CV (PDF):** Your professional and academic curriculum vitae.
4.  **Academic Qualification (PDF):** A digital scan of your highest academic qualification (e.g., PhD, Master's, Bachelor's, or High School Diploma).
5.  **Motivation Letter (PDF):** An A4-page letter. This letter is critical. It must demonstrate that you have a deep and thorough understanding of the ColivingLiguria project from reading this website (e.g., [[Ville Chiappella]], [[Openings]], our legal framework). It must explain exactly why you want to join, which role you intend to fill, and what skills you bring to it.
6.  **Proof of B2 English (PDF or Link):** You must prove a minimum B2 English level. Please provide *one* of the following:
    * A scan of an official language certificate (PDF).
    * A link to a short presentation video of yourself in English (e.g., unlisted YouTube or Google Drive link, included in your email).
    * Alternatively, you may send a WhatsApp voice note introducing yourself to `+39 339 637 9372` *just before* you send the email.

**A final, crucial note on your Motivation Letter:** The use of AI (Artificial Intelligence) to write any part of your application is strictly forbidden. We use tools to detect AI-generated text. If your application is flagged, it will be automatically and permanently discarded. We want to hear *your* voice.

Once you have gathered these results and sent your complete application, we can then schedule a call to discuss how to proceed.
