> This page outlines our visa assistance policy. In summary, **we do not offer visa assistance** as a standard service. We only provide legally registered Lease Agreements (`Contratto di Locazione`), which are **not** offers of employment. To our knowledge, a lease agreement is not a valid basis for a visa application.
>
> We are only open to discussion if an applicant conducts their own in-depth legal research and submits a formal proposal (see below) demonstrating a viable, legally sound path for us to provide documentation.

### 1. Our Legal Framework: Lease Agreement vs. Employment

It is essential to understand that ColivingLiguria **does not offer jobs** in the traditional sense. We offer partnership opportunities and residency.

* **What We Offer:** All stays are formalised through a [[Contract for Residents]], which is a legally binding Italian Lease Agreement (`Contratto di Locazione`). This document establishes you as a tenant.
* **What We DO NOT Offer:** We do not offer employment contracts, volunteer contracts (as defined by Italian law), or any documentation that implies a work-for-stay arrangement. As clarified in our [[Limiti Legali del Volontariato|Legal Boundaries of Volunteering]] policy, residents have no obligation to perform work.

To our knowledge, a standard lease agreement is not sufficient grounds to secure a visa for a non-EU citizen.

### 2. General Policy: No Visa Assistance

Given the legal framework above, we cannot and will not issue letters of invitation or employment contracts to support a visa application. We cannot justify the significant administrative time to support an application that has no clear legal basis.

### 3. Exception: The "Applicant-Led Legal Research" Path

We may consider making an exception in rare cases, under the strict condition that **the applicant does all the legal groundwork.**

If you believe a viable legal path exists that would allow you to obtain a visa based on a residency agreement with us, you must conduct in-depth research into Italian law (e.g., Italian Civil Code, Court of Cassation rulings, immigration decrees).

You must then submit a formal proposal to us that clearly and precisely outlines this legal path.

### 4. How to Submit a Visa Proposal

If you are confident in your legal research, you must submit a complete application package to colivingliguria@gmail.com. The application must contain all of the following components.

#### A. The Formal Legal Proposal
Your proposal must:
1.  Be based on verifiable Italian legal sources.
2.  Provide a clear, precise, and step-by-step outline of the process.
3.  State *exactly* what documentation you are requesting from ColivingLiguria.
4.  You **must** CC the email address of the nearest Italian Consulate or Embassy in your country. This is for transparency, so they can verify that your proposed legal basis is correct and sensible.
5.  It is highly advantageous to also include a formal statement from a registered Italian lawyer or a consulate official certifying that your proposal is legally sound.

#### B. The Personal Application Packet
Alongside the legal proposal, you must include:
1.  **Your Full CV.** Where possible, claims made on the CV must be substantiated with proof.
2.  **Academic Qualification:** A digital copy of your last academic qualification is mandatory (e.g., PhD, Master's, Bachelor's, or a high school diploma if no higher education has been completed). Translations are not required, but if you have them, please send them in English.
3.  **Motivation Letter:** Approximately one A4 page, detailing:
    * Why you specifically want to be part of ColivingLiguria.
    * Which role(s) from our [[Openings]] page you wish to fill.
    * What specific qualifications and skills you bring to those roles.

#### C. Language Verification (B2 English Minimum)
You must demonstrate a minimum B2 level of English.
1.  **Certification:** The easiest way is to provide a copy of an official certificate (e.g., IELTS, TOEFL, Cambridge).
2.  **No Certificate?** If you do not have a certificate, you must send a WhatsApp voice note to `+39 339 637 9372` introducing yourself in English.
3.  **Better Yet:** The best alternative is to attach a short video presentation of yourself (in English) to your application email.
4.  **Next Step:** If your application is considered, a video call will be scheduled.

### 5. Strict Prohibition on Artificial Intelligence

The use of AI (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) for any part of your application—including drafting texts or your motivation letter—is **strictly forbidden**. We have tools to detect AI-generated content. If any part of your application is found to be written by AI, your application will be **automatically and permanently discarded**.
