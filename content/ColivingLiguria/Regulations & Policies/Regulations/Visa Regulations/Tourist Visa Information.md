> This page provides general information for non-EU citizens interested in visiting Coliving Liguria on a standard Schengen Tourist Visa (Type C). While we do not offer visa sponsorship or employment, we can provide supporting documentation (such as a registered rental contract) to strengthen a legitimate tourist application. This page outlines the typical requirements, the challenges you may face, and how we can assist you within our legal framework.

### Important Disclaimer
Coliving Liguria is a residency project, not an employer or a visa agency. The information on this page is for guidance only and is based on general requirements for Italian Schengen visas. **We cannot guarantee visa approval**, as this decision rests solely with the Italian Embassy or Consulate in your home country.

Before proceeding, please read our general **[[Visa Assistance Policy]]** to understand our strict limitations regarding visa support.

### The Challenge: Proving Intent to Return
For many non-EU applicants, especially from countries with high migration rates, the most significant hurdle is not just proving you can afford the trip, but proving you will **return home** afterwards. Embassies often reject applications due to a perceived "migration risk".

To overcome this, your application must include strong evidence of your ties to your home country, such as:
* **Stable Employment:** A permanent work contract, recent payslips, and social security registration.
* **Education:** Proof of ongoing university enrolment for future semesters.
* **Assets:** Ownership deeds for property, land, or a registered business.
* **Family Ties:** Marriage or birth certificates of children who remain in your home country.

### How Coliving Liguria Can Support Your Application
While we cannot influence the Embassy's decision on your intent to return, we can significantly strengthen the "subsistence" and "accommodation" parts of your application.

If you are accepted as a resident (following our **[[Admission Priorities]]**), we will provide you with a formal **[[Contract for Residents]]**.
* **Registered Contract:** We can register this contract with the Italian Revenue Agency (`Agenzia delle Entrate`), making it an official legal document.
* **Proof of Accommodation & Subsistence:** The contract can explicitly state that you have **pre-paid** for your entire stay and that this payment includes your accommodation and essential costs (like utilities and shared food contributions).
* **Benefit:** This officially proves to the Embassy that your basic needs in Italy are guaranteed, potentially reducing the amount of personal savings you need to demonstrate in your bank account.

### Standard Visa Requirements (Checklist)
Always verify the specific list of required documents with the Italian Consulate or the external visa service provider (e.g., VFS Global, TLScontact, Almaviva) in your country. Generally, you will need:

1.  **Visa Application Form:** Fully completed and signed for a Schengen Visa Type C (Tourism).
2.  **Valid Passport:** Must be valid for at least 3 months beyond your planned departure from the Schengen area.
3.  **Photo:** Recent passport-style photographs compliant with ICAO standards.
4.  **Travel Itinerary:** Flight reservations showing entrance and exit from the Schengen area (usually, buying the actual ticket before visa approval is not recommended, but check local rules).
5.  **Travel Health Insurance:** A policy covering at least €30,000 for emergency medical expenses and repatriation, valid for the entire Schengen area.
6.  **Proof of Accommodation:** Your signed and registered **[[Contract for Residents]]** with Coliving Liguria serves this purpose perfectly.
7.  **Proof of Financial Means:** Recent personal bank statements (usually last 3-6 months). Even with our contract covering basics, embassies typically require you to show access to some additional funds for personal expenses and travel within Italy.
8.  **Proof of Socio-Economic Situation:** The critical documents mentioned above (work contract, student status, etc.) to prove your intent to return.

### The Application Process
1.  **Secure Your Spot:** First, apply to join us by following the instructions on our **[[Contact]]** page. Mention your need for a visa in your initial email so we can discuss feasibility.
2.  **Sign the Contract:** If accepted, we will proceed with the **[[Onboarding]]** process, where you will sign the **[[Contract for Residents]]** and pay the required deposit/rent.
3.  **Receive Documents:** We will send you the registered contract and any other necessary supporting letters from our side.
4.  **Book Embassy Appointment:** Schedule your visa appointment well in advance (at least 4-6 weeks before travel) in your home country.
5.  **Submit & Wait:** Attend the interview, submit all documents, provide biometric data, and await the decision.

### A Final Note on "Volunteering"
Please remember that even if you plan to help out in the community, you are legally applying as a **tourist** with a **rental contract**, strictly NOT as a volunteer or worker.
* Mentioning "work" or "volunteering" during your visa interview could lead to immediate rejection, as a tourist visa does not permit these activities.
* Ensure you fully understand your legal status as a resident by reading our **[[Limiti Legali del Volontariato]]** page before your interview.
