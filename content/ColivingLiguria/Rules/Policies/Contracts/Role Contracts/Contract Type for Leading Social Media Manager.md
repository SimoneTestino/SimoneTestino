> This document outlines the partnership framework for the **Social Media Team Leader** at [[ColivingLiguria]]. This is a senior role for an entrepreneurial individual, structured as a long-term B2B (Business-to-Business) collaboration. The model is built on a base in-kind compensation package, supplemented by two distinct, high-value incentive structures: one for long-term commitment (Longevity) and one for measurable results (Performance).

### Role Overview & Legal Structure

* **Role:** Social Media Team Leader
* **Workload:** A baseline commitment of `HOURS_PER_WEEK` (e.g., 15-25 hours) per week.
* **Legal Prerequisite:** This is a B2B partnership. The candidate must have, or be willing to open, their own independent company (such as a Ditta Individuale with *Regime Forfettario* in Italy) to legally invoice ColivingLiguria for services.

### 1. Base Compensation Package

In exchange for the weekly time commitment, the Team Leader receives a comprehensive in-kind "salary" designed to cover all major living expenses.

* **Accommodation:** A private room at [[Ville Chiappella]]. Legally, this will be formalised with a contract at a symbolic, "below-market" fee (e.g., `SYMBOLIC_RENT_FEE` per month) to cover utilities.
* **Food:** All community food expenses are covered by the project.
* **Full Access:** Free access to all courses, workshops, and activities offered by [[Supplementary Projects]] at Coliving Liguria.

### 2. The Incentive & Bonus Structure

This is a dual-path model. You are rewarded for **staying** (Longevity) and for **achieving** (Performance).

#### 2.1. The Longevity Bonus (Equity Path)

This rewards long-term commitment and strategic alignment.

* **Trigger:** Successfully completing `N_YEARS` of continuous collaboration under this contract.
* **Reward:** The Team Leader will be granted `Y%` of the legal ownership (equity) of a specific, pre-defined project asset `ASSET_NAME`.
* **Vesting:** This is a "cliff" model. The equity is earned in full after the `N_YEARS` period is complete. If the collaboration is terminated by either party before this date, this specific bonus is forfeited.

#### 2.2. The Performance Bonus (Milestone Path)

This rewards measurable, data-driven success.

* **Principle:** When a specific milestone (e.g., a follower count) is reached on a social platform, the Team Leader earns a percentage of the profits from a **fixed, pre-determined fiscal year**.
* **Key Logic:** The reward is tied to a *past* year (e.g., "Fiscal Year 2"). This is designed to remove any incentive to postpone reaching a milestone. Whether the target is hit in Year 3, 4, or 5, the prize money is based on the *same* fixed amount, encouraging you to win as fast as possible.
* **Condition:** The Team Leader must be an active collaborator at the time the milestone is reached to claim the reward.

##### Example Milestone Structure:

| Platform  | Milestone Target    | Reward (One-Time Bonus)            |
| :-------- | :------------------ | :--------------------------------- |
| Instagram | 100,000 Followers   | `A%` of Fiscal Year 2's Net Profit |
| Instagram | 500,000 Followers   | `B%` of Fiscal Year 3's Net Profit |
| TikTok    | 200,000 Followers   | `C%` of Fiscal Year 2's Net Profit |
| YouTube   | 100,000 Subscribers | `D%` of Fiscal Year 3's Net Profit |

*This structure is an example. The final set of milestones and rewards will be defined in the specific contract.*

### 3. List of Contract Variables

To turn this framework into a concrete instance of a contract, the following variables must be defined and mutually agreed upon:

* `HOURS_PER_WEEK`: The expected weekly hour contribution.
* `SYMBOLIC_RENT_FEE`: The minimal monthly rent/utility fee.
* `N_YEARS`: The number of years for the Longevity Bonus (e.g., 3).
* `Y%`: The equity percentage for the Longevity Bonus (e.g., 10%).
* `ASSET_NAME`: The specific real estate asset for the Longevity Bonus (e.g., "[[Casa del Noce]]").
* `MILESTONE_TARGETS`: The list of specific numbers for each platform (e.g., 100k, 500k).
* `REWARD_PERCENTAGES`: The `A%`, `B%`, `C%` values for each milestone.
* `FIXED_PROFIT_YEARS`: The specific, pre-determined fiscal years used to calculate the reward for each milestone (e.g., "Fiscal Year 2", "Fiscal Year 3").
