> This document outlines our strategy for attracting paying guests to Coliving Liguria. Our approach is multi-channel, with a primary focus on reaching our core market of digital nomads and remote workers, while also catering to short-term vocational guests.
### Understanding Our Customer Segments

Our strategy is built upon a clear understanding of the different types of guests we aim to host. As detailed in our [[Rentals Customer Matrix]], our audience ranges from short-term tourists to long-term remote residents. This page details the specific channels we will use to reach each segment.
### Channels for Attracting Guests
#### 1. Short-Term & Vocational Stays

For traditional tourists and guests seeking shorter stays, we will establish a presence on major online travel agencies (OTAs).

* **Action:** Create and optimise detailed listings on the following platforms:
    * Airbnb
    * Booking.com
    * Other similar platforms.
#### 2. Digital Nomads & Remote Workers (Primary Focus)

Our core strategy is focused on attracting medium to long-term residents who are remote workers. This requires a targeted approach beyond standard booking sites.

* **Facebook Groups:** A crucial part of our strategy is to engage directly with digital nomad communities.
    * **Action:** Compile a precise and curated list of Facebook groups for digital nomads, remote workers, and expats, particularly those focused on Italy and Europe. We will then engage with these communities to promote our offering.
* **Specialised Platforms:** We will list Coliving Liguria on websites dedicated to the remote work and coliving lifestyle.
* **Potential Agency Collaboration:** We will investigate partnerships with agencies that specialise in marketing and advertising to the digital nomad community.
### Internal Community: A Key Source of Customers
Our own community is a vital and organic source for acquiring paying guests. We actively encourage a fluid transition between different roles within the project.

Individuals who initially join us as collaborators under our `comodatario` framework are ideal candidates to become paying guests. A positive experience participating in the community life can naturally lead to a desire to extend their stay in a different capacity, either as a remote worker renting a room or as a vocational guest. This internal pipeline is a cornerstone of our strategy for building a stable and engaged resident community.
