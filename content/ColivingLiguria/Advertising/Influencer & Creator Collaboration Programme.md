> This page outlines a special, limited-time collaboration offer for content creators and influencers. As we launch Coliving Liguria, we are seeking to partner with creative individuals to help share our story. In exchange for promotion, we are offering free or heavily discounted stays at our villa. This is a unique opportunity to experience the Ligurian countryside while helping us grow our community from the very beginning.

To celebrate our launch, we are offering a unique opportunity for influencers on TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook to collaborate with us. This is our way of building an authentic presence through genuine experiences, making it the most cost-effective advertising we can afford. Please note that this programme is only available during the initial phase of our activity.

### Want to Stay Longer for Free? The Volunteering Option

If you fall in love with the project and wish to extend your stay, we are very open to it! The offers above can be extended if you choose to contribute as a volunteer.

Social media management is a key area where we need help, and your expertise would be highly valued. If you decide to volunteer, your stay could become entirely free, following the same rules and agreements as our other [[Volunteers]]. This can be discussed and arranged on a personal basis.
### How to Apply

If you are a creator and this opportunity interests you, the best way to start is by getting in touch with me, [[Simone Testino]], directly. Send me a link to your social media profiles and a brief note about why you'd like to collaborate.

You can find all my contact details, including email, WhatsApp, and social media, on the [[Contact]] page.
