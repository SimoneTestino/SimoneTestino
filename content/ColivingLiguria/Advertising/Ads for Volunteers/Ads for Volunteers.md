> This page outlines our strategy for finding and engaging with individuals who wish to collaborate with the Coliving Liguria project. It details the platforms we will use for outreach and the long-term vision for how these collaborators can become integral parts of our community.

### Understanding Our "Volunteer" Framework
Before detailing our recruitment strategy, it is essential to understand the legal context in which we operate. As outlined in our [[Limiti Legali del Volontariato]] page, we use the term "volunteer" colloquially. Legally, our collaborators are not volunteers but are residents under a `comodato d'uso` agreement, contracted professionals, or independent entrepreneurs. It is crucial that this distinction is made clear in all our communications.
### Recruitment Channels
To find individuals interested in joining our project, we will establish a strong presence on various online platforms.
#### 1. Facebook Groups
Facebook is a powerful tool for reaching niche communities. The first step is to systematically identify and engage with relevant groups.

* **Action:** Create a comprehensive database of Facebook groups focused on:
    * Volunteering in Italy and Europe.
    * Digital nomads and remote workers.
    * Sustainable living, permaculture, and community projects.
    * Travel and backpacking in Italy.
* **Strategy:** Once the list is compiled, we will create engaging posts that clearly outline the opportunity, the legal framework, and the unique experience offered at Coliving Liguria.
#### 2. Dedicated Volunteer & Work Exchange Platforms
To maximise our reach, we must be present on all major platforms dedicated to work exchange and volunteering.
* **Action:** Create and maintain detailed, appealing, and transparent profiles on the following websites:
    * Workaway
    * Worldpackers
    * HelpX (Help Exchange)
    * HippoHelp
    * The Nomadic Network
* **Strategy:** Our profiles will highlight the unique educational and community aspects of a stay with us, ensuring we attract individuals who are genuinely interested in our project's vision.
### The Strategic Value of Collaborators
Our approach to collaboration goes beyond simple work exchange. We view our "volunteers" as potential long-term members of the Coliving Liguria ecosystem. Every individual who joins us is seen through a wider lens, with several potential pathways for their journey:
1.  **Transition to Paying Guests:** A positive experience as a collaborator can lead to a desire to stay longer. Many may transition into becoming paying guests, perhaps opting for a shared room at a reduced rate, thus contributing to the project's financial sustainability.
2.  **On-site Project Development:** Collaborators with an entrepreneurial spirit are encouraged to develop their own projects. They can transition from a `comodatario` to an independent entrepreneur who rents space and resources from us, generating profit for themselves and creating a more vibrant community. More details on this can be found on our [[Propose a Project]] page.

By viewing collaborators not just as temporary help but as potential future residents and partners, we aim to build a dynamic and self-sustaining community.
