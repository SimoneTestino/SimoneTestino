> This page outlines the collaborative approach we take to social media. It details the legal framework for our collaborators and lists the key strategies and tasks for promoting projects associated with Coliving Liguria.
### Our Approach to Community & Customers
At Coliving Liguria, we are looking to engage with two primary groups of people:
1.  **Collaborators:** Individuals who wish to participate in the life of our community. This is a general term for residents who align with our vision and contribute to the house's atmosphere and projects in various legally defined ways. You can find more on our [[Ads for Volunteers|recruitment strategies for collaborators here]].
2.  **Customers:** Guests who book a stay with us for short or long-term periods. Our approach to attracting them is detailed in our page on [[Ads for Customers]].

Our communication and marketing methods are tailored to these different groups. For a detailed breakdown of our customer segments and how we target them, please refer to our [[Rentals Customer Matrix]] page.

The following sections detail the social media strategies that our collaborators can engage in.
### Our Collaborative Social Media Framework

It is essential to understand the legal premise of our collaborative model. The social media tasks outlined here are **not framed as work performed for Coliving Liguria**. Instead, they are considered independent activities undertaken by collaborators who are developing their own projects while in residence.

These individuals are formally **renting spaces and resources from Coliving Liguria** to build their own ventures, such as a photography school or language courses. The social media work they perform has a dual benefit: it primarily promotes their own project, and in doing so, it also enhances the visibility and appeal of Coliving Liguria. For instance, a resident developing a photography school would manage social media to attract students, which simultaneously showcases the vibrant, creative environment of our location.
### Key Social Media Tasks & Strategies

#### 1. Facebook Group Outreach

A primary task is to engage with relevant communities on Facebook to attract guests, clients, and future collaborators.

* **Objective:** To raise awareness of both the collaborator's independent project and Coliving Liguria within targeted online groups (e.g., digital nomads, slow travel, remote workers in Italy).
* **Key Actions:**
    1.  **Compile a Curated List:** The first step is to research and create a precise list of the most relevant and active Facebook groups that align with our target audience.
    2.  **Develop Messaging Templates:** Create a set of clear, engaging, and customisable messages that can be posted in these groups.
    3.  **Engage Authentically:** Post the messages and actively participate in conversations, responding to comments and inquiries in a helpful and authentic manner.

#### 2. Influencer & Creator Collaborations
Another key strategy is to partner with content creators and influencers whose audience aligns with our values. This involves identifying potential partners and developing mutually beneficial collaboration proposals, as detailed on our [[Influencer & Creator Collaboration Programme]] page.
