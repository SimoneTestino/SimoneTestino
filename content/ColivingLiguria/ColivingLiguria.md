Welcome to Coliving Liguria, a project born from a desire to create a unique space where productivity, community, and nature converge. Nestled in the hills of the Ligurian hinterland, just a short drive from the sea, we are transforming a traditional villa into a vibrant hub for remote workers, volunteers, and creative minds.
### The Project Today: We're Choosing Our Home!
This is the most exciting phase of our journey. We are currently in the final stages of selecting the perfect property that will become the heart of Coliving Liguria. Our goal is to finalise the choice by the **10th of August** and to have the villa operational and ready to welcome our first guests by the **1st of September**.

This is an ambitious timeline, and the process is complex. You can follow every step of this crucial stage on these pages:
-   **[[Acquisto Immobiliare - ColivingLiguria]]**: Dive deep into our selection criteria, the legal process, and the financial details of the purchase.
-   **[[Calendar]]**: Check our live calendar for the most up-to-date milestones and key dates.

### The Vision: Life at the Villa
Our goal is to create an environment that balances focused work with a strong sense of community and a connection to the stunning Italian landscape. The villa will offer:
-   **Private rooms** for personal space and quiet time.
-   Spacious **shared areas**, including a large kitchen, comfortable living rooms, and dedicated co-working spaces.
-   **High-speed internet** as a top priority, ensuring a seamless remote work experience.
-   A welcoming atmosphere for **pets** and ample space for those travelling with **camper vans**.

### How to Get Involved
Whether you are a digital nomad seeking a productive escape, a volunteer wanting to contribute your skills to a hands-on project, or simply someone curious about a different way of living, there is a place for you here.

Given the dynamic nature of this phase, we have moved away from formal applications. The best way to get involved is to **reach out directly**. We can discuss your interests, skills, and how you see yourself fitting into the project on a case-by-case basis. Please see our [[Contact]] page and the [[Whatsapp Community]] for all the ways to get in touch.
