> Welcome to Coliving Liguria, a project to transform traditional properties in the Italian Riviera into vibrant hubs for remote workers, volunteers, and creative minds. This page outlines our vision, our current projects, and the many ways you can join our growing community.

Welcome to Coliving Liguria, a project born from a desire to create a unique space where productivity, community, and nature converge. Nestled in the hills of the Ligurian hinterland, just a short drive from the sea, we are transforming traditional villas and farmhouses into homes for a new generation of creators and thinkers.

### Our Live Projects
#### The Adventure Begins: Our First Home in Urbe!
This is the most exciting phase of our journey. We have the keys! The project has officially moved from planning to reality, and our first coliving house is now taking shape in the beautiful municipality of **Urbe (SV)**. We are on-site, setting up the foundational infrastructure and preparing the house to welcome our community.

You can follow every step of this crucial stage on our dedicated page for the house, which includes details on the property, our immediate plans, and the current living situation.
* **[[Vara Superiore]]**: Discover our new home and get all the latest updates.
#### Join Us on the Ground: Immediate Volunteer Openings
This is a unique chance to be involved from the very beginning. We are looking for **two volunteers** to join us immediately for this foundational phase. The available roles are:
1.  **Community & Operations Support (Hands-On)**
2.  **Digital Storyteller & Project Support (Hybrid)**

If you are interested in helping to build this project from the ground up, please find all the details on our **[[Vara Superiore]]** page.

#### Coming Soon: Rooms for Remote Workers
As we renovate and furnish our home in Urbe, we are planning our offering for digital nomads and remote workers. We anticipate being able to offer private master bedrooms with shared facilities starting from **€300 per month**. Keep an eye on the [[Vara Superiore]] page and our WhatsApp group for the official launch date.

#### We're Expanding: Property Partnerships
As our project grows, we are actively looking for new properties to bring into the Coliving Liguria family. We specialise in taking on rustic farmhouses (`cascine`) to renovate and manage through a partnership model. If you own a property in the Ligurian hinterland and are interested in a hands-off way to bring it to life, learn more on our page about the [[Diventa Partner di Coliving Liguria|Property Partnership Programme]] (Note: Our website is bilingual, but this page is currently available in Italian only).
#### Do you want to do the same by yourself? Project Launch Consultancy
Drawing from our direct experience in securing EU funding and navigating Italian bureaucracy, we also help other aspiring entrepreneurs. We offer [[Project Launch Consultancy; Funding & Bureaucracy in Italy|consultancy services]] to guide you through the process of launching your own project in Italy.
### The Vision: Life at the Villa
Our goal is to create an environment that balances focused work with a strong sense of community and a connection to the stunning Italian landscape. Our properties will offer:
* **Private rooms** for personal space and quiet time.
* Spacious **shared areas**, including a large kitchen, comfortable living rooms, and dedicated co-working spaces.
* **High-speed internet** as a top priority, ensuring a seamless remote work experience.
* A welcoming atmosphere for **pets**. (Note: Our policy for the house in Urbe is still being finalised during this initial phase. Please see the [[Vara Superiore]] page for the latest updates.)
* Ample space for those travelling with **camper vans**.
