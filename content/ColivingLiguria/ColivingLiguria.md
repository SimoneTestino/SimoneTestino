### Our Vision & Current Status
Our project is born from a desire to create a unique space where productivity, community, and nature converge. We are currently operational in our [[Vara Superiore|first house]], with two apartments available. Our ambitious plan is to have two villas under our management by the end of the year, offering a total of 25-30 bedrooms. You can follow our high-level progress on the main [[Calendar]].
### Life at Vara Superiore: Our First Home
Our first location, **[[Vara Superiore]]**, is now active.
* **Accommodation:** We currently offer two private master bedrooms for rent and one large shared room for up to six collaborators (currently capped at four).
* **Amenities:** We are setting up a high-speed internet connection of at least **150 Mbps**. Pets are welcome; for the first three months, there are no particular limits, and we are preparing dedicated outdoor spaces for them, both shaded and warmed.
* **Detailed Plans:** Follow the setup and renovation progress on the specific [[Calendar Vara Superiore]].

### Activities, Courses & Projects
Coliving Liguria is a hub for learning and adventure, with many activities driven by our residents.
* **Current [[Supplementary Projects]]:** Our ecosystem of independent projects is growing. Current ventures include **[[Italian Classes]]**, a **[[Photography Course by Chris]]**, and the development of **[[Downhill Tracks]]**.
* **Planned Activities:** We plan to organise yoga and sports courses, group trips to nearby cities like Turin, Milan, and Genoa, and excursions to local villages like Finale Ligure. Hikes and mountain bike tours will also be a core part of our offering.
* **Participation:** Most activities are included for paying residents. Collaborators can join on a case-by-case basis or pay for individual courses. All details will be published on the respective project pages once they are active.
* **Propose Your Own Venture:** We actively encourage residents to launch their own initiatives. Learn how on our [[Propose a Project]] page.
