Coliving Liguria is a project that is home to people who do remote work and volunteers who want to contribute to the project, both to the house in its physical state and to the business overall.

Coliving Liguria is thought to be a great resource for people who want to live comfortably and enjoy sharing spaces in a community, while still keeping their own private room. It is a place to live in the amazing landscapes of Liguria, Italy, at only some minutes from the beach.

The whole project has been funded primarily thanks to the European Union through the [[Bando Pubblico Fesr 2021-2027. OS 1.3]], published by the Region of Liguria. The founder of the project is [[Simone Tesitino]].
