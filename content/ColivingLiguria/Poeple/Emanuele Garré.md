Emanuele Garrè played a helpful role in getting the Coliving Liguria project started. He contributed to the complex search for the villa, assisting with the bureaucracy and handling key aspects that could be managed remotely. He also provided practical support by personally joining the first property visits. Emanuele's help was present throughout the process, from the initial viewings to the final purchase of the villa.
