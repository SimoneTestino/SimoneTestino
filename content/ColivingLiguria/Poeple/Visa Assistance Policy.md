> This page outlines our visa assistance policy. In summary, we offer visa assistance to paying guests (remote workers and vocational stays) for bookings over €200, once the booking is confirmed. For volunteers, we generally do not offer visa assistance due to the significant time investment and the legal complexities of the Italian immigration system, which does not have a specific "volunteer visa". Exceptions are very rare and are considered only for individuals with pre-agreed, essential skills required for the project.

Navigating visa requirements can be a complex process. This page clarifies the support ColivingLiguria can offer to international guests and volunteers who require a visa to enter Italy. Our policy is designed to be transparent and reflects the legal and administrative realities of the Italian system. To understand better how we categorise people invited to stay at ColivingLiguria, read [[Rentals Customer Matrix]].
### For Paying Guests (Remote Workers & Vocational Stays)
We are happy to offer visa assistance to guests who book a stay as a remote worker or for a holiday. This support typically involves providing an official booking confirmation and a letter of invitation that you can use for your visa application.

This service is available under the following conditions:
1.  **Confirmed Booking:** The booking must be fully confirmed and paid for before we can issue any documentation.
2.  **Minimum Value:** The total value of the booking must be **€200 or more**.

**Rationale:** The process of preparing visa support documents requires a significant administrative time investment on our part. We have set this minimum threshold to ensure that this effort is directed towards guests with a confirmed and substantial commitment to staying with us.

### For Volunteers
As a general rule, **we do not offer visa assistance for volunteers**. This policy is in place for several important reasons.

1. **Legal Framework in Italy:**
	Italy does not have a specific "volunteer visa" for short-term projects like ours. For non-EU citizens, obtaining a visa that allows for a long-term stay often requires an official offer of employment. Issuing an employment contract is a significant legal and financial commitment that involves tax contributions and complex bureaucracy, which is simply not feasible for a volunteer position.

2. **Justification of Time Investment:**
	Assisting with a visa application is a time-intensive process. As volunteers do not provide a direct cash flow to the project, we cannot justify the significant administrative hours required to support an application that has a very high probability of being rejected by the authorities due to the lack of a proper legal framework for volunteering.

**Exceptional Circumstances:**
We may consider making an exception to this rule in **very rare and specific cases**. This would only apply to individuals who possess **specialised, essential skills** that have been discussed and pre-agreed upon as being critical to the project's success.

In these exceptional cases, the following conditions apply:
-   A minimum stay of **at least two weeks** is required.
-   The volunteer's skills and their essential role must be clearly documented in advance.
-   Even in these cases, **flight costs are never covered**, and food costs are not covered in the vast majority of circumstances.

We believe this transparent approach is the most responsible way to manage expectations and ensure that all our collaborations are on a sound and legal footing.
