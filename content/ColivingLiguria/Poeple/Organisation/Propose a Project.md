> [!Abstract]  Share Your Idea with Coliving Liguria
>At ColivingLiguria, we believe that great ideas can come from anywhere. Whether you are a volunteer, a guest, or simply someone passionate about our vision, we welcome you to submit your own project proposals. This page outlines how you can contribute your ideas, from small improvements to brand-new ventures.

As the founder and owner of ColivingLiguria, my primary responsibility is to ensure the long-term sustainability and coherence of the entire project. Therefore, every new idea must be evaluated against several key criteria.

My role is to:
1.  **Assess Financial Viability:** I will review your proposal to ensure it aligns with our financial resources, budget, and overall business strategy.
2.  **Ensure Strategic Fit:** I will verify that your project is consistent with the long-term goals and values of Coliving Liguria.
3.  **Prevent Conflicts:** I will check for any interference with other ongoing projects. Some of our initiatives are public, while others are still in development. As I am the only one with a complete overview of all current and future plans, this oversight is crucial to ensure that new projects integrate smoothly.

Ultimately, as the owner with a long-term stake in the project's success, the final decision on whether to approve and implement a proposal rests with me.

### How to Submit a "Concept Proposal"
To propose an idea, you need to create a document that clearly outlines your vision. You don't need to use a specific Google Doc template; simply create your own document and ensure it includes the following sections.
1. **Abstract (Max 300 words)**
	* Provide a brief, clear summary of your project. What is the core idea? What problem does it solve or what value does it create?

2. **Technical Plan & Calendar**
	* **Method:** How do you plan to achieve your goal? Describe the practical steps.
	* **Timeline:** How long will it take? Provide a simple calendar with key phases and an estimated completion date.

3. **Budget & Resources**
	* **Costs:** What is the estimated budget? List the key expenses.
	* **Spaces:** What physical spaces will you need? (e.g., indoor workshop, outdoor garden area, etc.)
	* **Tools:** Will you need access to specific tools or resources we have on-site (e.g., 3D printers, workshop tools)?

### Two Ways to Collaborate: Defining the Legal Framework

It is crucial that every project is legally and fiscally transparent. We do not engage in any "off-the-books" or untaxed activities. Therefore, your project must fit into one of the two following models:
-  **Model A: Your Independent Project (Renting Our Resources)**
	* **What it is:** You run your own project and simply use Coliving Liguria's resources. This could involve renting a physical space (indoor or outdoor), using our tools, or leveraging other assets.
	* **Ownership & Profit:** The project, its intellectual property, and all profits are **100% yours**. You are an independent operator.
	* **Legal Structure:** We will sign a formal rental or service agreement that clearly defines the terms and costs for using our resources.
- **Model B: A Coliving Liguria Project (You as a Contributor)**
	* **What it is:** Your idea becomes an official Coliving Liguria project. We invest our resources, time, and funds to make it happen.
	* **Ownership & Profit:** Coliving Liguria (and therefore, I as the owner) will have **full ownership** of the project and any resulting profits. I will have final say on all decisions.
	* **Your Remuneration:** Your contribution will be formally recognized and compensated. This can be structured in several ways, such as:
	    * Free or significantly discounted accommodation at the villa.
	    * A pre-agreed share of the profits generated by the project.
	    * A combination of both.
	* **Legal Structure:** We will sign a collaboration agreement that details your role, responsibilities, and the exact terms of your remuneration.

When you submit your proposal, please indicate which of these two models you envision for your project.

### How to Submit Your Proposal
While thinking whether you should submit or not your proposal, you should get in [[Contact]] with me and schedule a meeting, either in person or on Google Meet (see [[Availability]]). It is definitely fruitful if at the time of the meeting you already come prepared with data and details about how you envision the project to be. After this meeting, I will let you already know what my general thoughts are about the project and which questions need to be addressed in detail. Once that has been done, then you can proceed with the submission of the project. To submit your Concept Proposal, please follow these steps carefully. This ensures that every idea is received, reviewed, and considered in a structured manner.

1.  **Prepare Your Document:** Create a single document that contains all the sections mentioned above (Abstract, Technical Plan, Budget, and preferred Collaboration Model). You can also include any further material, such as sketches, links, or detailed calculations, within the same document.

2.  **Format and Length:** The final document must be in **PDF format**.
    * For a **minor proposal** (e.g., a small garden project, a weekend workshop), a concise document of **1-3 pages** is perfectly fine.
    * For a **major proposal** (e.g., a new business venture, a project requiring significant investment or time), we expect a much more detailed and comprehensive plan.
3.  **Send via Email Only:** All proposals must be sent exclusively by email to:
    **colivingliguria@gmail.com**

Please do not send proposals via WhatsApp, Instagram, or any of the community groups. This is to ensure we can track and evaluate every idea properly. For any preliminary questions before sending your full proposal, you can get in touch via any of the channels on our [[Contact]] page.
