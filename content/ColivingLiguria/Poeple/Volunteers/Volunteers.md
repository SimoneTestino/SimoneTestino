Volunteers are going to be a central part of the entire project, contributing their skills and motivation to bring it to life. I’ve been genuinely amazed by how many people from all over the world are willing to come and help, each bringing a unique background and a wealth of experience. This diversity, combined with their bare hands and energy, is what will make the project possible—transforming something that would have taken me over a year to complete into a joyful, collective experience we can build together.

However, this also brings several challenges. Organising a group of people for a full day, especially on a project far outside my own area of expertise, is no easy task. Some volunteers will arrive already skilled, with more technical knowledge than I have myself, while others—likely the majority—will need guidance, structure, and clear instructions. This difference in experience levels becomes the main limiting factor in the size and complexity of the group I can effectively manage. To address this, I’m putting a lot of effort into planning every step of the volunteer journey, from the first contact to the final goodbye, as clearly and efficiently as possible.

Once someone hears about the project through one of the [[Social Media]], I’ll direct them to the "[[To Share Page]]", which offers a concise but accurate overview of the initiative. From there, they’ll find a link to the [Application Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9yjx_LboaTdGZLBx25R6sZ-udozPtgDDUxVz3ybQLMuSA9Q/viewform?usp=header), allowing me to keep all applicants in a central database from which I can select volunteers as needed.

The selection process itself is not straightforward. Several factors will play a crucial role, including the applicant’s skillset and how well it aligns with current needs listed on the [[Task Management]] page, bureaucratic feasibility (as issuing work visas is often complicated or impossible), how their proposed dates fit within the [[ColivingLiguria/System/Calendar]], and—perhaps most importantly—their motivation and commitment.

As mentioned, one of the biggest challenges will be assigning the right task to the right person. You’re encouraged to browse the [[Task Management]] page to see what projects are ongoing and consider where your strengths might fit in. For many applicants, we may not be able to identify a suitable role within the core renovation or technical work. However, since we also offer options for Holiday Rental and Remote Work Rental, a hybrid arrangement is always possible. In such cases, volunteers might contribute a larger share of the [[Volunteers#Shared Expenses]] or simply register as a renter. They would still be welcome to stay in the house and contribute as much or as little as they like.

This more relaxed option will always be offered as an alternative (or hybrid) to the more work-intensive [[Volunteers#Volunteer Offer]], and will remain significantly more affordable than our standard Holiday Rental rate.
## Volunteer Offer
Once a prospective volunteer has completed the application form available on the [[To Share Page]], I will follow up with further questions to better understand how they might fit within the [[Task Management]] structure and the existing [[ColivingLiguria/System/Calendar]]. We will then discuss the general House Rules for Volunteers and agree on the terms of the [[Volunteers#Shared Expenses]].

All this information will be consolidated into a single PDF document, which I will sign and send to the volunteer. They will be asked to return the document signed, along with a scanned copy or a clear photo of a valid ID card or passport.
### Shared Expenses
In principle, I am deeply grateful for the contributions of volunteers and, ideally, would love to cover all related expenses myself. However, this project already involves substantial financial commitments, and keeping essential services—such as water and electricity—running in a house shared by several people adds up quickly. These ongoing costs would be difficult to sustain within the current budget without a degree of support from volunteers.

That said, shared expenses are not straightforward. Not everyone has the same financial flexibility—some may be happy to cover the cost of water or food, while others may not be in a position to contribute financially at all. Furthermore, the roles and durations of involvement among volunteers will differ significantly: some may only stay for a few nights, others may settle in for several months; some may bring essential technical skills to the table, while others might be working full-time remotely during their stay.

Consequently, the financial contribution of each volunteer will vary depending on a number of factors—these include relevant skills, hours worked, general efficiency, accommodation type (private or shared), individual financial circumstances, and the overall demand for space at any given time.

All contributions from volunteers will be used strictly for communal needs, such as food, utilities, and other shared essentials. These will directly benefit those participating in the project. Each volunteer's contribution will be agreed upon in advance with me and recorded transparently on the [[Volunteers#Volunteer Offer]] page.
#### Sharing Utility Costs
While food and water costs tend to remain fairly stable throughout the year, the same cannot be said for heating, which represents around 80% of the utility expenses. Heating will be by far the largest cost and is heavily concentrated in the colder months.

Logically, one might think to split utilities according to monthly usage—so that those staying during the winter would pay more. However, this would result in disproportionately high expenses during the winter months, which also coincide with the project’s lowest expected income due to its seasonal nature. This mismatch would cause a serious negative cash flow exactly when it’s least sustainable.

To avoid this, I’ve decided to spread utility costs evenly throughout the year. This way, I can purchase heating materials (such as firewood and pellets) in advance and distribute the cost more sustainably, avoiding sudden spikes during the colder season.

Before anything takes action, I will need to make sure that what I write in [[Legal Constrains on Volunteers]] are valid legal conclusions.
