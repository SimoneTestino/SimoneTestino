For such a small project having an application page with modules to compile is certainly not necessary, though it helps to speed up things and have all the relevant information of someone willing to contribute and gives everyone equal chances to present themselves. I will try to make the process as smooth and quick as possible!

Linked below you find a Google Form that will guide you through all the steps, it should require not more than 5 minutes to complete. Don't forget to add your *documents* and *contacts*!
