> Are you into creative projects, nature, and looking for a unique life experience off the beaten path? Join my project to bring a traditional Ligurian villa in the hills and at 10' from the beach back to life. I’m a 22-year-old Italian Master student in Mathematics taking a gap year to create a vibrant coliving and coworking space.

📍 **Location:** Savona Riviera hinterland, Liguria, Italy <br> 📅 **Start Date:** Flexible from early September

Welcome to the Coliving Liguria project! The vision is to create a beautiful villa in the Ligurian hills, a space for remote workers to focus and for volunteers to contribute their energy to a shared home and business.

We are currently in the final stages of selecting the perfect property. You can follow the process in detail on the [[Acquisto Immobiliare - ColivingLiguria]] page (in Italian). Our goal is to find the definitive villa by the **10th of August** and to have the space ready and operational for our first guests by the **1st of September**. Of course, these timelines are ambitious, and you can find a more detailed schedule of all milestones on our [[Calendar]] page.

We are looking for curious and motivated people, what matters most is your energy, openness to collaboration, and love for nature. Whether you have skills in gardening, social media, construction, or any kind of creative work, there's a place for you here.

### 🏠 The Villa and Lifestyle
The property will be a spacious traditional villa, offering each guest a private bedroom with shared access to all essential amenities, including a large kitchen, bathrooms, and common areas for relaxing or working. A stable, high-speed internet connection is a top priority from day one.

The villa will be pet-friendly and also suitable for those travelling by camper van, with plenty of outdoor space. All utilities like clean water, electricity, heating, and basic furnishings will be provided. We are still defining the final details, but you can see our vision for the ideal property here: [[Acquisto Immobiliare - ColivingLiguria]]. We will update this page with photos and much more information as soon as the final choice is made.

### 💻 Remote Work & How to Join
Are you a digital nomad? We are committed to providing a reliable internet connection (aiming for  200 Mbps or more) to ensure you can work productively surrounded by nature.

If you are interested in joining the project as a volunteer, a remote worker, or simply as a guest, the best way is to get in touch directly. We can discuss all the details - from accommodation costs to how you can contribute - on a case-by-case basis to find the perfect fit for you.
