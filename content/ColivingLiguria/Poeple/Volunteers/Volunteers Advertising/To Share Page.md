> [!Abstract] In Short  
> Are you into DIY, gardening, or just looking for a unique life experience off the beaten path? Join my mountain house renovation project. I’m a 22-year-old Italian Mathematics Master’s student taking a gap year to bring an old mountain home back to life.

📍 **Location:** [Caprieto](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GqysjFFMsiKuRpVF7?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy), Genoa, Liguria, Italy  
📅 **Start Date:** Flexible from mid-July

You can find the application form here: _**[Application Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9yjx_LboaTdGZLBx25R6sZ-udozPtgDDUxVz3ybQLMuSA9Q/viewform?usp=header)**_.

My new house will become not only a future home, but also a potential [[Airbnb]] location, a space for [[Event Hosting]], a small [[Pet Hotel]] and offer rooms for [[Remote Work Rental]]. If you want to read more about who I am, here you find all information about [[index#Me]].

You’re welcome to join if you’re curious and motivated - what matters most is your energy, openness to collaboration, and love for nature. Whether you’re experienced in [[Task Management#Gardening]], [[Task Management#Advertising & Social Media]], [[Task Management#Construction & Hard DIY]], or any kind of [[Renovation Work]], there’s space for you here. You can find more details on this in [[Task Management]].
## 🏠 House and Services
The [[House Choice#House]] is a spacious rural property, starting early [[Calendar#August]], will be offering each guest a private bedroom and shared access to essential amenities such as a kitchen, bathroom, and common spaces for relaxing or working. Plans for stable [[Internet Access]] (at least 50–100 Mbps) are underway. The property is pet-friendly and also suitable for those travelling by camper van, with available outdoor space for parking and leisure. Clean water, electricity, heating, and basic furnishings are all provided.

Many of the everyday comfort details—such as how food is managed, whether rooms are private or shared, and how utilities are split—will be discussed individually based on your preferences (you can indicate them below). More information is available in [[Volunteers#Shared Expenses]]. Please note that this arrangement may evolve in the future, especially if some of the [[Business Segments]] become operational, potentially allowing shared meals or basic ingredients to be covered. For now, however, the contribution remains strictly limited to the offer of free accommodation.

If you’re interested, you’ll need to complete a short 5-minute application form. This helps ensure a good fit and gives me a clearer picture of your motivations, expectations, and skills. At present, several [[Volunteers]] have expressed interest. For the initial phase, there will only be two double bedrooms available (in addition to my own). You can expect a response by the 10th of July—further details are available on the [[Calendar]].

### 🛏️ Just looking to relax?
If you're not in the mood to commit fully to the project or would simply prefer to take some time off and enjoy the peaceful setting, that's absolutely fine! I'm happy to arrange either a private or shared room for guests who choose not to volunteer. You can still take part in the experience and enjoy all its benefits, with accommodation offered at a very low cost. Prices are flexible and arranged on a case-by-case basis, but will not exceed €150 per month for a private room.

### 💻 Can I work remotely?
Are you a digital nomad planning to work while staying here? There will be unlimited internet access from day one, with speeds between 50–100 Mbps. Improving this connection is one of my main goals, and I am actively exploring faster alternatives such as [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/gb/specifications?spec=4) or advanced 4G+ solutions via a nearby antenna to guarantee a stable, high-speed connection even in this rural location. In order to pay for the stay you can either refer to the prices above, work in the weekends/freetime or anything in between.

### 🚐 Travelling with a camper van?
If you're exploring the area in your own camper and would like to park nearby while using the house’s water and electricity, we can certainly accommodate you. There is plenty of space in the surrounding garden, and I’d be happy to make arrangements—just get in touch (see [[Contacts]]) so we can plan it together!
