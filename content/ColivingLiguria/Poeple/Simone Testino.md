I am currently a Master's student in Mathematics at the University of Amsterdam, where my field of study is Logic. You can find more about me on the [Home Page]().

This year, I have decided to take a gap year to dedicate my energy and resources to founding two distinct projects that I am passionate about: [[ColivingLiguria]] and [[Luna]]. These ventures are being brought forward using my current finances and the support of a public grant I was awarded.

A core value of mine is transparency, and I believe in an "open book" approach, especially from a financial perspective. For this reason, on this website, I not only share details about my professional projects but also about my [[Personal Finance]].
### My Role
I am the founder and owner of the ColivingLiguria project. The venture is legally owned by my Italian sole proprietorship (Ditta Individuale) registered in my name, "Simone Testino". As the owner, I am fully responsible for the project's direction and operations.
