The goal is to create an organised space where every member can find relevant information, participate in focused discussions, and feel part of a specific group without being overwhelmed by unrelated messages. The community is the main container, and within it, you will find several groups organized by level of involvement.
### Group Structure: A Hierarchy of Involvement

Our community is structured in levels. The first level is open to everyone, while access to higher levels is by invitation only, based on your active role in the project.
#### **I. 📢 Open Group**
* **Purpose:** This is our public gateway. It's the perfect place to follow the project's progress, receive major announcements, and ask general questions. If you're curious about Coliving Liguria and want to stay in the loop, this is the group for you.
* **For Whom:** Anyone interested in the project! This group is open for everyone to join.
#### **II. ⭐ Ex Loco**
* **Purpose:** To maintain a connection with those who have already experienced Coliving Liguria. This is the group for staying updated on major project milestones, receiving invitations to future events, and continuing to be part of our story from a distance.
* **For Whom:** All former volunteers and guests. Once you're part of the family, you can stay in this group for as long as you like.
#### **III. 🏡 In Loco**
* **Purpose:** For managing the day-to-day life inside the villa. Here we organise shared dinners, cleaning schedules, outings, grocery runs, and all the little things that make co-living special.
* **For Whom:** Exclusively for people who are physically staying at the villa at any given time, whether they are guests, volunteers, or collaborators. This is a dynamic group; you join upon arrival and leave upon departure.
#### **IV. 🛠️ Active Projects**
* **Purpose:** The operational heart of the project. This group is for discussing the hands-on work at the villa: what needs to be done, who is doing what, and what materials are needed. It's the channel for coordinating active contributions.
* **For Whom:** All officially accepted volunteers and collaborators (e.g., after signing the volunteer agreement) who are ready to actively contribute with their work.
#### **V. 🧠 Core Team**
* **Purpose:** This is the strategic group, the "brain" of the project. Here we discuss ideas, long-term development, bureaucratic matters, and the key decisions that will shape the future of Coliving Liguria.
* **For Whom:** This is a limited-access group for the **Core Team** of people who make up the long-term foundation of the project.
### How to Join the Community
* **Level 1 (Public Access):** You can join our main public group via this link: [Open Group]()
