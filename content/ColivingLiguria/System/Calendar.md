### Project Calendar & Timeline
Welcome to the project's live timeline! We've secured our first home and have moved from planning to action. This page outlines the key high-level milestones for our projects.

For a more detailed, month-by-month breakdown of our current focus, please see our dedicated page for the **[[Vara Superiore]]** project.

#### **Phase 1: Planning & Foundation at Vara Superiore (September – November 2025)**

This is the current, hands-on foundational phase. We have access to the property and are focused on detailed planning and initial improvements to structure a long-term agreement with the owner.

* **Early September: Contract Finalisation & Initial Setup**
    Our first goal is to sign the temporary 3-month management agreement for the first two apartments. We will immediately begin the initial setup and onboard the first collaborators.

* **End of September: Digital Twin Creation**
    We will complete a detailed 3D model of the entire 300 m² property, which will serve as the basis for the comprehensive renovation plan.

* **End of October: Comprehensive Project Plan**
    We will finalise a detailed plan that includes renovation specifics, financial projections, and the proposed purchase price and conditions for a long-term agreement.

* **End of November: Final Proposal to the Owner**
    The initial three-month period culminates with the presentation of a formal contract proposal to the owner, outlining the terms for proceeding with the acquisition or long-term management of the house.

#### **Phase 2: Expansion to Calizzano (Anticipated Q4 2025 – Q1 2026)**

With our first location structured, our focus will shift to acquiring and launching our second, larger property.

* **Goal for Beginning of October: Secure [[Villa Calizzano]]:** We plan to finalise the acquisition of our second property, [[Villa Calizzano]].
* **Capacity Goal: 12 Bedrooms Live:** Upon securing the villa, our objective is to immediately have 12 bedrooms available for the community in Calizzano.

---
#### **Phase 3: Growth and Consolidation (Anticipated Q1 2026)**

This phase is focused on scaling up both locations to their full potential.

* **Goal for End of December: Calizzano Upgrade:** We will complete renovation work at [[Villa Calizzano]] to expand its capacity from 12 to 15 bedrooms.
* **Goal for Beginning of January: Full Ownership of [[Vara Superiore]]:** Following the proposal in November, our aim is to complete the rent-to-buy process for our first home, taking full ownership of the entire building.
* **Capacity Goal: Urbe Expansion:** Full ownership will unlock the remaining apartments, adding 12 more bedrooms at our [[Vara Superiore]] location.

> **Our Vision for Early 2026:** By the beginning of January, our goal is to operate a total of **27 bedrooms** across two unique locations (15 at [[Villa Calizzano]] + 12 at [[Vara Superiore]]).
