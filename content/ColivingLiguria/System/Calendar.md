### Project Calendar & Timeline
Welcome to the project's timeline! This page outlines the key milestones as we move towards securing our new home and welcoming the first volunteers. The process is dynamic, but here is our ambitious plan.

---
#### **Phase 1: The Final Choice (August 1st - August 10th)**

This is the most crucial and fast-paced phase of the project. Our focus is on identifying and securing the perfect property.

* **Now - August 10th:** We are actively visiting and evaluating a shortlist of properties. You can see the properties we are considering on the [[House Choice]] page.
* **Goal for August 10th:** By this date, our objective is to have selected our target villa from the list. The chosen property will be clearly marked on the [[House Choice]] page, and we aim to have already submitted our official purchase proposal.

---
#### **Phase 2: Securing the Villa (August 10th - September 1st)**

Once the proposal is submitted, the bureaucratic process begins. Our goal is to finalise the purchase and get the keys in hand as quickly as possible.

* **Goal for September 1st:** We aim to have completed the entire purchase process and have the keys to the villa. This would allow us to welcome the first volunteers and begin setting up our new home from the start of September.

### **Understanding the Timeline's Uncertainty**

It is very important to understand that this timeline is a goal, not a guarantee. The process of purchasing a property in Italy, especially when financed through a public grant, involves many steps and potential delays that are outside of our direct control.

If you want to understand the complexities, the legal conditions, and the variables that can influence the timeline between now and when we get the keys, the best resource is the sample purchase contract itself.

You can find the official contract template (in Italian) on this page: **[[Acquisto Immobiliare - ColivingLiguria]]**.

> **Tip:** To read the contract, you can use your browser's built-in automatic translator (e.g., in Google Chrome, right-click and select "Translate to..."). It will allow you to understand the document in any language you like.
