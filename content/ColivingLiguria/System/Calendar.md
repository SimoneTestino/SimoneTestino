### Project Calendar & Timeline
Welcome to the project's live timeline! We are currently in a temporary operational phase while we finalise the acquisition of our first permanent property. This page outlines the key milestones for the upcoming period.

#### **Phase 1: Temporary Base & Property Search (Now – 5th October 2025)**
This is our current, hands-on phase focused on finalising the purchase of our first home.

* **Current Status:** We are based in a temporary rented apartment in Giusvalla, which serves as our operational hub. Our stay here is planned until the 5th of October 2025.
* **Primary Objective:** Our main goal during this period is to identify and complete the purchase of our first permanent villa.

#### **Phase 2: Launch of Our First Home (From 5th October 2025)**

Immediately following our temporary stay, the project will move into its new home.

* **The Goal:** To have a house purchased and to move into our new, permanent location.
* **Next Steps:** Once the property is secured, we will begin the detailed planning for renovations, operations, and welcoming our first residents and collaborators.

#### **Future Expansion**

Our long-term vision remains ambitious. We plan to have a second villa under our management and to operate a total of 25-30 bedrooms by early 2026. This calendar will be updated with specific locations and detailed timelines as soon as our first property is secured.
