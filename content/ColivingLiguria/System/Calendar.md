### Project Calendar & Timeline
Welcome to the project's live timeline! We've secured our first home, [[Casa Urbe]], and have moved from planning to action. This page outlines the key milestones as we set up our first location, expand to our second, and grow our community. Here is our ambitious plan.

---
#### **Phase 1: Foundational Setup at Casa Urbe (Now – End of August 2025)**

This is the hands-on, foundational phase. We have the keys and are focused on transforming our first property from an empty house into a vibrant home, ready for our first guests.

* **Current Status:** We are operational at **[[Casa Urbe]]**! We currently have access to two apartments, providing a total of four bedrooms.
* **Immediate Goal: Volunteer Onboarding (This Week):** We have immediate availability for our first volunteers. The primary mission is to help us set up the initial bedrooms to get them ready for our first paying guests.
* **Parallel Goal: Digital Team Launch (This Week):** We are launching a volunteer-driven social media and customer service team. This dedicated group of professionals will work 5-10 hours every day to promote the project and manage inquiries. This initiative will be ongoing and will expand over time.
* **Target for September 1st: Ready for First Guests:** By the beginning of September, our goal is to have essential services like hot water and full electricity operational at [[Casa Urbe]] and to welcome our very first paying guests.

#### **Phase 2: Expansion to Calizzano (September – October 2025)**

With our first location up and running, our focus will shift to acquiring and launching our second, larger property.

* **Goal for Beginning of October: Secure [[Villa Calizzano]]:** We plan to finalise the acquisition of our second property, [[Villa Calizzano]].
* **Capacity Goal: 12 Bedrooms Live:** Upon securing the villa, our objective is to immediately have 12 bedrooms available for the community in Calizzano.

#### **Phase 3: Growth and Consolidation (November 2025 – January 2026)**

This phase is focused on scaling up both locations to their full potential.

* **Goal for End of December: Calizzano Upgrade:** We will complete renovation work at [[Villa Calizzano]] to expand its capacity from 12 to 15 bedrooms.
* **Goal for Beginning of January: Full Ownership of [[Casa Urbe]]:** Our aim is to complete the rent-to-buy process for our first home, taking full ownership of the entire building.
* **Capacity Goal: Urbe Expansion:** Full ownership will unlock the remaining apartments, adding 12 more bedrooms to our Urbe location.

> **Our Vision for Early 2026:** By the beginning of January, our goal is to operate a total of **27 bedrooms** across two unique locations (15 at [[Villa Calizzano]] + 12 at [[Casa Urbe]]).
