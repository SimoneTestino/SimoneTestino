✨ Seeking Volunteers & Remote Workers ✨ for 🏡 Villa Renovation Project 🏡

📍 Location: Ligurian Riviera hinterland, 🇮🇹 Italy 🇮🇹 — in the 🏔️ mountains a short drive from the 🌊 sea!

🗓️ Availability: We're in the final setup phase! The first spots will be available very soon (from late October onwards). Reach out now to be considered!

Hey everyone! I'm Simone, a 22-year-old student taking a gap year to make a dream a reality. Are you into DIY, gardening, creative projects, or just looking for a unique life experience off the beaten path? Join my project to bring a traditional Ligurian villa complex, "Ville Chiappella," back to life!

🔨 What’s the Plan?
We’re transforming these beautiful, spacious villas into a vibrant coliving space for remote workers, volunteers, and anyone who wants to take a break from frustrating city life! All genders, backgrounds, and experience levels are welcome – your energy and curiosity matter more than your résumé.

🧑‍🔧 Who We’re Looking For:
• Enthusiasts with hands-on skills or a strong motivation to learn
• People who love gardening, DIY, or eco-living
• Individuals open to teamwork and cultural exchange
• STEM folks welcome too—there’s also a startup project in the works!

🏡 What You Get:
We have two main ways to join:

1️⃣ Full Volunteer: Contribute ~25-30 hours/week in exchange for a free spot in a private or shared room.
2️⃣ Hybrid Option: Want more free time? Contribute fewer hours and pay a reduced rent. We can find a flexible solution that works for you!

Both options include:
• A spot in a beautiful villa (be prepared for rustic conditions at first!)
• High-speed Internet is a top priority! (aiming for 50–100 Mbps or more)
• Pet-friendly 🐾 and camper-van-friendly 🚐
• Nature all around for hiking, climbing, biking, and peace of mind
• I speak Italian, English, and German to a native level, pick what you're most comfortable with!

💻 Looking for a serene and budget-friendly spot to work remotely? This is it! We're committed to providing a reliable internet connection so you can be productive surrounded by nature.
