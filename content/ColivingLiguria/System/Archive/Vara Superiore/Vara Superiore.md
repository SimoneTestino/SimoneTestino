> Great news, we have the house! This page is the official hub for our new headquarters in Urbe. We have the keys, and the project is now entering its most exciting phase. This document outlines the property's details, our initial renovation and operational plans, and how you can be one of the first to get involved with the [[ColivingLiguria]] project on the ground.

### 🏡 Description of the House and Grounds
We have secured a fantastic independent house located in Urbe. The property is a large, 300 m² building in good condition, uniquely structured as six separate apartments: five units of approximately 50 m² each, and one larger main apartment of 100 m². This layout offers incredible flexibility for creating both private and communal living spaces. The house sits on a 600 m² plot of land with a private garden and terrace.

* **Address:** Via Vara Superiore, 86, Urbe, Savona

### 🛌 Accommodation and Living Situation
Availability starts right now! We already have access to the first apartment, which has two double bedrooms, one kitchen, and one bathroom. We will be getting access to a second, identical apartment very soon, where we will also begin cleaning and renovation planning.

The double bedrooms are large enough to accommodate three people each, giving us a maximum capacity of six. However, for comfort and because we are in the very early stages, we will be hosting a maximum of four people in total for now (me, Parisa, and two volunteers).

Please be aware of our power situation for the first month. We will have electricity from a single solar panel, which will be sufficient for charging laptops and phones. However, this will **not** be enough to power appliances for cooking or to heat water. This is a temporary setup for the very beginning of the project.

Please also note that we are still figuring out our pet policy. For these first few weeks, pets are not allowed. We will make a final decision later, which will likely be on a case-by-case basis.

### ✨ The First Volunteer Opportunities
We are looking for **two volunteers** to join us immediately for this foundational phase. This is a unique chance to be involved from the very beginning as we set up the house and the project. The expected work time is 6 hours per day. The two roles are:

1. **Community & Operations Support (Hands-On):**
This person will be the heart of our daily life. The main tasks will be hands-on and focus on creating a comfortable and welcoming home. This includes the periodic cleaning of the bathroom, floors, and kitchen. A major and rewarding task will be the gardening; although the garden is not huge (under 400 m²), it is not in good condition and needs a proper renovation plan to make it look nice. This role also involves cooking. At the beginning, we will have shared meals, so this person will prepare lunch and dinner to ensure we can all eat together and that food is always ready for those who are working. They will also be responsible for keeping the kitchen clean at all times.

2. **Digital Storyteller & Project Support (Hybrid):**
	This is a hybrid role. A minimum of three hours per day will be dedicated to building our social media presence, with the remaining hours devoted to hands-on tasks like cleaning and gardening, which are essential at the start. The social media duties are crucial and include:
	* **Instagram Management:** Posting stories, reels, and updates on a daily basis to keep our community informed about our progress, interesting things in the area, and developments in the project.
	* **Facebook Recruiting:** Actively managing our Facebook presence, responding to comments and posts, and handling inquiries from potential future volunteers and clients.

### 🚗 Transport and Arrival

To get here, you can take a train to any station in **Genoa**. A member of the team will pick you up from there by car and bring you directly to the house. For this first week, I can offer pickups on **Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday**.

Once you are here, we will soon have a scooter available for independent travel. If you have a standard car license that is valid in Italy, you will be able to drive it. If not, we will drive you when necessary.

### 📝 Project Plan & Next Steps
Our next steps are focused on detailed planning to transform this house into a fully operational coliving space. Our interior designer, **Parisa**, will lead the creation of a comprehensive design plan to renovate the house and make it look its best. This will involve taking detailed measurements of the entire building to create a complete 3D model in Fusion 360. This digital twin will allow us to control every aspect of the renovation and plan any changes with precision.

In parallel, I will be drafting the long-term contract. The plan is to establish a rent-to-buy agreement where the profits from renting rooms to remote workers will go to the owner, plus a premium, until the property becomes ours. We foresee this process taking no longer than a year from now.

It is important to note that two of the five apartments are currently rented out. The owner is confident the tenants will leave very soon, though we suspect it may take longer. Since the apartments are totally separate from where we will be staying, this does not affect our immediate plans. In fact, we see this as a positive, as it will likely be a good point of negotiation to lower the final price of the property.
