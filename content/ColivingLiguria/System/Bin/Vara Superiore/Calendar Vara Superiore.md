> This page outlines the strategic timeline for our new headquarters in Vara Superiore. The next three months are a foundational period dedicated to detailed planning, initial improvements, and structuring the long-term future of the project at this location.
### Phase 1: Foundation & Planning (September 2025)

* **Early September: Contract Finalisation**
    The primary goal is to sign the temporary management agreement which grants us control over apartments 1 and 3 for the upcoming three months, from September until the end of November.

* **Throughout September: Initial Setup & Light Renovation**
    We will immediately begin making the accessible apartments more comfortable. This will be a budget-focused renovation, utilising materials we already own or can acquire for free to enhance the living space.

* **End of September: Digital Twin Creation**
    A detailed 3D model of the entire property will be created. This "digital twin" will cover all five apartments (four units of approx. 50 m² and one of 100 m², for a total of ~300 m²) and will be instrumental in finalising the comprehensive renovation plan.

### Phase 2: Detailed Analysis (October 2025)

* **End of October: Comprehensive Project Plan**
    By the end of this month, we will have a finalised and detailed plan for the property. This document will be crucial as it will define the proposed purchase price and the conditions under which we would proceed with a long-term agreement. It will include a precise strategy on how to renovate and improve the entire building.

### Phase 3: Final Proposal (November 2025)

* **End of November: Final Proposal to the Owner**
    The initial three-month period culminates at the end of November. By this date, the light renovation of the initial spaces will be complete, and the financial and renovation plan will be finalised. We will then present a formal contract proposal to the owner, which will precisely outline if and how we intend to proceed with the acquisition or long-term management of the house. We are confident that we will have an interest in staying.
