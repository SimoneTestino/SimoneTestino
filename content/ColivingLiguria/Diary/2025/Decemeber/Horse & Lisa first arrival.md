> **Operation First Arrival: Lisa & The Horses**
> This operational plan details the onboarding strategy for the first resident (Lisa), her three horses, and her associated entourage (Film Crew & Students). It manages the critical transition period between the current "Limbo" phase and the official project start on December 3rd, ensuring legal compliance with ASL regulations regarding the **Codice Stalla** and the physical preparation of the **Temporary Shelter**.

## Phase 1: The "Limbo" (Now - Dec 3rd)
*Objective: Manage Lisa's immediate needs without compromising the legal status of the property transfer.*

* **Immediate Personal Housing (Nov 26th - Dec 3rd)**
    * **Constraint:** We cannot legally host Lisa in [[Ville Chiappella]] before the deed is signed on Dec 3rd.
    * **Action:** Direct Lisa to a temporary B&B or rental in Cairo Montenotte for these specific days. This keeps her close for the transition but legally separate.
* **Horse Logistics (The "Holding Pattern")**
    * **Constraint:** Horses cannot enter **[[Terreni oltre Torrente]]** until the **Codice Stalla** is active. This code cannot be requested until we own the land (Dec 3rd).
    * **Option A (Preferred):** Horses remain in Tuscany until approx. Dec 10th (post-Code activation).
    * **Option B (Emergency):** If they must move immediately, we must locate a third-party stable ("Stalla di appoggio") nearby. Estimated cost: ~€300/month/horse.
* **Bureaucracy & Contracts**
    * **Lisa:** Must sign the **[[Contract for Residents]]** for her room.
    * **Horses:** Must sign the **[[Contract for Horses]]** and pay the deposit.
    * **Students/Crew:** Finalise financial proposal (€220/month per student) and prepare agreements.

## Phase 2: Terrain & Shelter Setup (Nov 27 - Dec 2)
*Objective: Create the "Minimum Legal Viable Product" on the land to pass the ASL inspection immediately after the deed.*

* **Location:** **[[Terreni oltre Torrente]]** (Particelle 104 & 105).
* **The Temporary Shelter (The Box)**
    * **Specs:** Construct a temporary wooden/pre-fab box of approximately **30 m²**.
    * **Legal Requirement (Ground):** Ensure the flooring is prepared (gravel or rubber mats) to guarantee a **permanently dry and clean surface**. Mud is a violation of welfare standards.
    * **Legal Requirement (Height):** Minimum safety height approx. 2.70m to prevent head injuries.
* **Fencing**
    * Secure the perimeter of the 1,240 m² paddock.
    * **Strict Rule:** Use electric tape or wood. **NO barbed wire** is permitted.
* **Water Supply**
    * Install electric pump from the stream.
    * **Action:** Prepare water analysis sample to prove potability for the ASL Code application.

## Phase 3: Activation & Logistics (Dec 3rd Onwards)
*Objective: Bureaucratic activation and physical move-in sequence.*

* **Step 1: The "Code Stalla" (Dec 3rd)**
    * Immediately upon signing the deed, apply to ASL 2 Savonese to register the land.
    * Once the Code is issued, Lisa generates the **Modello 4** (Transport Document) for the journey.
* **Step 2: Human Accommodation Setup**
    * **Lisa's Unit:** Assign a private bedroom. **[[Casa del Forno]]** (Sub. 5 or 6) is recommended due to the existing kitchen layout.
    * **The "Flex" Apartment (Film Crew -> Students)**
        * **Requirement:** A liveable apartment with **2 Private Bedrooms**, Kitchen, and Bathroom.
        * **Dec 14th:** Film Crew (2 pax) moves into these 2 rooms for ~1 week.
        * **Dec 20th:** Film Crew departs; **2 Students** move into the *same* 2 bedrooms for their 2-month stay.
* **Step 3: Holiday Guests (Dec 23 - Jan 7)**
    * Reserve capacity (4-8 beds) for potential bookings mentioned in chat.
    * **Contingency:** If **[[Casa Maggiore]]** is acquired/available, use it for this overflow. If not, maximise density in **[[Casa del Forno]]**.

## Critical Dependencies
* **Utilities:** Electricity must be active by Dec 3rd. Water may be temporary/bottled initially.
* **Heating:** Ensure specific rooms for Lisa and Crew have functional heating (wood stoves/electric) as December temperatures will be low.
* **Access:** Clear the path from **[[Terreni oltre Torrente]]** to **[[Casa del Noce]]** / **[[Casa del Forno]]** for daily horse management.
