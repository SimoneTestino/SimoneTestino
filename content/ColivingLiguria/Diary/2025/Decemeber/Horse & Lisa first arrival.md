> **Operation First Arrival: Lisa & The Horses (v2)**
> **Status:** Active Planning
> **Goal:** Orchestrate the arrival of the first resident (Lisa), her entourage (Film Crew/Students), and her 3 horses.
> **Key Challenge:** Managing two separate timelines—one for humans (dependent on renovation) and one for horses (dependent on ASL bureaucracy).

## 🗓️ The Timeline: Two Parallel Tracks

### Track A: The Horses (The "Limbo")
* **Duration:** From [Transport Date] until [ASL Stable Code Approval].
* **Status:** **Waiting for Bureaucracy.**
* **The Problem:** Horses cannot legally enter [[Terreni oltre Torrente]] without a *Codice Stalla*. This code can only be requested *after* the deed (Dec 3rd).
* **The Solution (Bridge Phase):**
    * **Location:** Third-party stable nearby (Simone to locate).
    * **Estimated Cost:** Approx. **€500 per week** total for 3 horses (to be paid by Lisa).
    * **Duration:** Estimated 1-2 weeks post-purchase (approx. Dec 3rd - Dec 14th), but could be longer depending on ASL speed.
* **The "Go Live" Condition:** Horses move to Coliving Liguria **only** when the ASL communicates the Code Stalla approval.

### Track B: The People (Lisa + Entourage)
* **Earliest Entry:** **Dec 12th** (Target date for viable bedrooms).
* **Location:** [[Casa del Forno]] or [[Casa del Noce]] (TBD based on renovation speed).
* **The Setup:**
    * **2 Private Bedrooms** made available immediately.
    * **Film Crew:** Stays in these rooms first (approx. 1 week).
    * **Students:** Move into these same rooms from Dec 20th onwards.
    * **Lisa:** Needs a separate room (potentially in the same house or nearby).

## 💶 Financial & Contractual Structure

### 1. The "Master Deposit" Strategy
To simplify the process while maintaining legal security, Lisa will act as the guarantor.
* **Deposit Amount:** **€500.00** (Total).
* **Coverage:** This single amount covers the security deposit for:
    * Lisa's personal **[[Contract for Residents]]**.
    * Up to **2 other contracts** for her guests (Film Crew / Students).
* **Terms:** If any guest causes damage or leaves early without notice, deductions are made from this master deposit.

### 2. Rent & Costs
* **Bedroom Price:** **€250.00 per month** per bedroom.
* **Utilities:** To be defined (likely included or flat-rate given the short term).
* **Horse Costs:**
    * **Bridge Phase:** ~€500/week (External Stable) - Paid by Lisa.
    * **Coliving Phase:** TBD (Internal costs).

### 3. Mandatory Contracts
*Even if Lisa pays, every individual must exist legally within the system.*
* **Lisa:** Signs [[Contract for Residents]] + [[Contract for Horses]].
* **Students/Crew:** Each person must strictly sign their own **[[Contract for Residents]]** to legitimize their presence on the property.
* **Payment:** Lisa settles the invoices, but the liability for conduct remains individual (secured by Lisa's deposit).
