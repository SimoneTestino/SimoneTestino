> This document outlines the planned activities and preparatory steps to be undertaken by the founder, [[ColivingLiguria/People/Simone Testino]], during the crucial week leading up to the definitive acquisition of [[Ville Chiappella]] on December 3rd, 2025. This period, from 26th November to 2nd December, focuses on pre-acquisition tasks, site assessments, and initial preparations.

### Plans for 26th November (On-Site Visit)

On **Tuesday, 26th November**, [[ColivingLiguria/People/Simone Testino]] will make a vital on-site visit to the area.

* **09:00 - Visit to [[Casa Maggiore]]**:
    * The day will commence with a scheduled visit to the potential new property, **[[Casa Maggiore]]**. This visit will involve a comprehensive assessment and an initial estimate of its potential for integration into the project.
* **Utility Activation Procedures**:
    * The primary objective at [[Ville Chiappella]] is to initiate the process for activating essential utilities (water and electricity).
    * **Action:** A formal PDF document will be prepared and signed by one of the current owners. This document will grant explicit permission to activate the utilities *prior to the final deed of sale*, with all associated costs to be borne by [[ColivingLiguria/People/Simone Testino]].
    * **Details:** For an in-depth explanation of the steps, contacts, and potential challenges, please refer to the dedicated page: **[[Attivazione Utenze]]**.
* **Exterior Photography**:
    * A significant portion of the time will be dedicated to capturing high-quality exterior photographs of the [[Ville Chiappella]] properties. These visuals are crucial for the **[[Marketing Team]]** to begin developing compelling social media content ahead of the official opening.
    * **Potential:** Collaboration with a friend possessing a drone may enhance the visual content, providing aerial perspectives.

### Remote Work & Terrain Assessment (27th November - 2nd December)

Following the visit, access to the houses will not be possible again until the formal signing of the deed on **December 3rd**. The rest of the week will be dedicated to remote work and assessment of the surrounding terrains.

* **Marketing Content Creation:**
    * The photographs gathered on 26th November will be sent to the **[[Marketing Team]]** for immediate processing and content generation.
* **Terrain Inspection & Documentation:**
    * Focus will shift to assessing the various land parcels associated with the project. This involves a detailed review of the three primary terrain pages:
        * **[[Terreni Lungotorrente]]**
        * **[[Terreni oltre Torrente]]**
        * **[[Terreni alla Fonte]]**
    * **Objective:** Following a thorough visual inspection (from the exterior), these pages will be updated with crucial information regarding their current state, estimated value, potential uses, and any initial findings.
    * **Initial Cleaning:** Where feasible and non-intrusive, some preliminary cleaning or clearing of the terrains may commence during this period.

### Next Steps: Final Acquisition (December 3rd Onwards)

This preparatory week culminates in the signing of the notarial deed on December 3rd. Upon formal acquisition, the immediate priority will be on gaining full access to the properties and initiating the hands-on setup phase.
