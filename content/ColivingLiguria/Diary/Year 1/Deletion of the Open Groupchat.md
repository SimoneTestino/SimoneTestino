> This document outlines a strategic change to the [[Whatsapp Community]] structure. Due to challenges with high notification volume and potential risks associated with a fully open forum in a rapidly growing community, the main public group is being restructured. The new model prioritises clear communication through an announcement-only channel, while fostering focused discussion in a new, invite-only group for active members.

Since creating the [[Whatsapp Community]], I have decided to restructure the [[Whatsapp Community#**I. 📢 Open Group**]]. This change is based on a couple of significant risks and a general feature of group behaviour that has become apparent.

Firstly, when people join a large group chat, they generally don't expect a high volume of notifications. The community has grown much faster than anticipated and now has over 150 members. If everyone were to post messages, it would quickly become a spam-filled chat, and the constant notifications would likely compel many interested people to leave. I have managed to keep the group relatively quiet so far, but whenever the number of messages increases, we see a clear pattern of members leaving.

Furthermore, an open group presents a more serious risk. As our numbers grow, we will inevitably attract individuals who are critical of the [[ColivingLiguria]] project, its [[Ethics of ColivingLiguria]], or me personally. An open chat gives them a perfect opportunity to easily reach everyone in the community, which could lead to negative publicity. I cannot expect every member to have the time or motivation to carefully consider any such claims; the immediate result is often just reputational damage.

For these reasons, I believe the best course of action is to have new members join the community's announcement channel directly, rather than the open discussion group. All essential information will be shared through the announcements, where I am the only person who can post. This ensures that important news reaches the widest possible audience without any spam.

We will create a separate, invite-only discussion group where members can chat and share ideas freely, without the worry that excessive messaging could reduce the community's overall size and reach. The other groups within the [[Whatsapp Community]] will remain unchanged for now, though it is likely we will add new chats in the near future to distinguish between the different villas.
