For now only these two, which I ordered today on the 26th of August and are going to arrive by amazon up here on the 28th.
### Project & Procurement Notes

#### 1. Laser Level
Initially, the plan was to acquire a self-levelling laser level. A suitable model, the Huepar Self-Levelling Laser, was identified on Subito, complete with a tripod, and the aim was to negotiate a purchase price of approximately €25, including shipping. The inspiration for its use came from this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/63rs8t4MFcg?si=Elmb3YkzBs2FcAvR).

However, upon further consideration, I have decided to postpone this purchase. For the immediate interior work, a standard spirit level placed on the floor will suffice to check for level, and a tape measure will be adequate for all other requirements. A laser level is not deemed essential at this stage, though it may prove useful for future landscaping projects, such as levelling the garden.

#### 2. Heavy-Duty Vacuum Cleaner
The intention is to purchase a **Lavor Freddy 1200W Wet & Dry Vacuum Cleaner** with a 20L tank. This machine is intended for heavy-duty cleaning tasks involving both solids and liquids, rather than for daily use. For routine cleaning, a Roomba will be acquired at a later date. Unfortunately, the specific second-hand unit I was monitoring has been sold, so the search will continue for another. Penso quindi di optare per prendere questo: https://amzn.eu/d/2abeV7B, da 16L 1200W mi costa il doppio ma almeno lo prendo su amazon cosi se ci fossero problemi si può fare il reso. 

#### 3. Concrete & Microcement Projects
I am exploring the creation of concrete countertops and outdoor furniture, inspired by this [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/qF_j0A0pZTI). The video highlights a significant challenge: the specialised countertop concrete mix used in the US is not readily available in Italy. Alternative solutions present their own difficulties:
* **Fibre-reinforced concrete** is recommended to prevent shattering but is prohibitively expensive (approximately €19 per 25kg bag).
* **Rapid-set cement** is a slight improvement over standard cement but is not ideal.

A more viable approach suggested is to use a finishing cement plaster over a timber base. However, this requires carpentry skills to build the underlying structure, which I feel falls outside my current expertise if the entire structure relies on it.

Therefore, the most practical solution seems to be applying a **microcement finish** to existing surfaces. This technique is demonstrated very effectively in this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/VGRdOoYnn0c?si=8aHsJCjqDRaXawNG). My plan is to modify the existing kitchen structure according to my design and then apply microcement to the countertop. To ensure it is durable and smooth enough for kitchen use, I will finish it with a protective resin, as shown in the original video. This same microcement technique could potentially be applied to other surfaces, such as doors, perhaps without the final resin coat.
