This section of my website is dedicated to aspects of my life that are unrelated to my academic pursuits. Here, I write about various other facets of my life that I consider productive. The topics covered can vary, ranging from [[Personal Finance]] to my [[Diary]] or [[Poems]]. On this page, I provide a list and brief descriptions of these folders.

I keep track of my [[Personal Finance]] and write several notes on the subject, some of which I choose to make public. This section is particularly significant because it aligns with my goal of using [[This Website]], this website, as an extension of my [[Curriculum Vitae.pdf]]. Here, I also provide details about my [[Jobs]], [[Investments]], and various [[Financial Ideas]].  

I also publish some of the [[Poems]] I write. Most of these date back to my [[Condensed Biography#School Years]], though some are more recent. I make an effort to dedicate time to this humanistic side of myself, despite its distance from my [[Research Areas]]. There I also list the [[Books]] I read and the [[Music]] I listen to.

Lastly, whenever I find topics of a more practical nature, such as politics or ethics, compelling enough to warrant discussion, I list my [[Opinions]] in the relevant folder. However, I always strive to uphold the principle of [[Ethics as Aesthetics]], that is, considering ethical statements as a matter of _taste_, not as outcomes of rational thought. For this reason, I choose to write these opinions in a provocative manner to encourage discussion. 

There are also some miscellaneous folders that I collect here, such as one where I write about [[Programs]], particularly focusing on [[LaTeX Commands]]. Another folder is dedicated to decisions I have made regarding my [[Health]], where I document my [[Medical Details]], maintain a record of my [[Family Medical History]], and track the [[Substances]] I consume.  I also have pages related to my [[Network]], with a particularly relevant section being my [[Academic Network]], where I list people indexed by their areas of expertise. Additionally, I keep track of and organise my [[Trips]] around the world in dedicated notes.
