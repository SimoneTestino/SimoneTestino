I see science, when viewed from a popular and political perspective, undergoing a peculiar process in recent times. In particular, under the current theme of liberty and freedom of speech—which gained particular importance during the early months of Trump's 2025 administration—science has taken on a new role in public discourse. This movement can most notably be observed in [Mark Zuckerberg on J. Rogan](https://youtu.be/7k1ehaE0bdU?si=azxW7UmfUwRN4wo0) and [Elon Musk on J. Rogan](https://youtu.be/7qZl_5xHoBw?si=FwGWd_5jx9naUWYh), where freedom of speech is defended a priori against government-imposed limitations on individual expression, particularly in online spaces.  

In these debates, science is presented as an accessible source of debatable knowledge—an alternative for those seeking a more substantiated approach than what is typically found on social media. It is also framed as a tool to quickly verify or refute claims made online.  

There are two particular approaches to science that I find deeply flawed and closely related to this phenomenon—two distinct forms in which _pop science_ is primarily encountered in today's media.  

### Starting from Flawed Data
I have no formal education in medicine, biology, or any related field, but I consider myself reasonably well-educated to the extent that I can distinguish a good argument from a bad one. However, arguments about most practical matters—such as whether vaccines have a net positive impact on society—must begin with non-trivial assumptions, typically derived from empirical investigations of various kinds. My lack of expertise in these fields makes me unable to judge whether the data presented in such debates is valid or biased. The only aspect I can evaluate is the logical soundness of arguments built upon that data.  

Given these limitations, I am convinced that if, from the beginning of my adult life, I had frequently listened to media like [Robert Kennedy Jr. on J. Rogan](https://youtu.be/p6LJXPOv4SM?si=Qk_qQZviDm5XcPss), or if such discussions were common on mainstream television, I would likely be anti-vaccine today—despite maintaining the same level of competence in my own research areas.  

### Simplistic Science  
There is another, yet related, approach to science: the portrayal of science as universally accessible and straightforward. In the aforementioned role of science as a tool for users on X to argue for or against claims, it is often assumed that scientific reasoning is readily available to everyone. This perspective is evident in discussions such as [Mark Zuckerberg on J. Rogan](https://youtu.be/7k1ehaE0bdU?si=azxW7UmfUwRN4wo0) and [Elon Musk on J. Rogan](https://youtu.be/7qZl_5xHoBw?si=FwGWd_5jx9naUWYh).  

A slightly different but closely related claim is that not only is science simple enough to be understood by anyone in the audience of social media, but that it should also be applied in its simplest form at a political level. This perspective can be found, for instance, in [Vani Hari on J. Peterson](https://youtu.be/yXHPN-qzKTg?si=eBrt0h-HtMqAyhQC).
