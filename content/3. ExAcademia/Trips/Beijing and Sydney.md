Based on the previous discussion about the [[Two Weeks Seminar in Beijing]] as a valuable academic opportunity, I’ve outlined the anticipated costs for such a trip next year. These figures are entirely hypothetical and not linked to any firm plans (for more context, see [Assume I finish the MoL in one year, what then](#)).

**Estimated Costs for Two Weeks in China:**  
- **Flight:** €520  
- **Food and Miscellaneous:** €5/day × 14 days = €70  

**Total for China:** €590

### Combined Trip to China and Sydney  
It may also be possible to combine this trip with a visit to Sydney, where I could meet Nia. If I pursue that option, the estimated costs for the flights (based on the lowest fares I found) would be as follows:  
- **Milan to Beijing:** €230  
- **Beijing to Sydney:** €200  
- **Sydney to Milan:** €450  

In Sydney, I could stay for free for a few nights in Nia’s dormitory. Extending my stay might be possible if the fines for exceeding the standard limit are minimal compared to hotel costs. This could be especially feasible since her roommate will be away during the semester break. I’d need to confirm the dates and any fines before making plans.

If accommodation is covered for both China and Sydney, I’d only need to account for food expenses. With relatively low living costs in China and the possibility of eating meals at home with Nia in Sydney, I estimate an average of €5 per day for food in each location. Over two weeks in each city, that comes to €70 for China and €70 for Sydney.

**Total**: €1,220

In order for this to happen I would have to make sure that the visit to Beijing happens during the dates in which Nia's housemate is out, this might turn out to be a major constrain.

\[05.04.2025\] The exact dates in which the stay in Sydney for 6 nights is guaranteed is between 30.06.2025.10:00 - 24.07.2025.7:00. I also asked today to Yurii to organise a research project [[Forcing on Urelements (Research Project)]] as a followup of [[Forcing (Research Project)]] in which I could prepare the material necessary for the [[Two Weeks Seminar in Beijing]].

\[09.04.2025\] The AUD/EUR exchange rate has indeed dropped due to Trump's tariffs, while Apple prices in Australia are expected to remain stable. The anticipation of increased prices for next-generation Apple devices attributed to these tariffs makes purchasing an Apple product, which could replace your current iPad Air M1, particularly advantageous. Your plan to buy a 15-inch MacBook Air M4 during this trip is a strategic choice.

The MacBook costs 1949 A$ [link](https://www.apple.com/au-edu/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/15-inch-sky-blue-m4-chip-with-10-core-cpu-10-core-gpu-16gb-memory-256gb#) in Australia with the education discount, while it is priced at 1369 € [link](https://www.apple.com/nl-edu/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/15%E2%80%91inch-hemelsblauw-m4-chip-met-10-core-cpu-10-core-gpu-16-gb-geheugen-256gb) in the Netherlands. You've already converted the required euros into Australian dollars through Revolut, resulting in no commission, and you expect to spend only 1060 € on the Mac. This implies a savings of 300 € compared to purchasing it in the Netherlands.

Consequently, this reduces the total cost of your trip to 900 € after accounting for the savings on the Mac purchase.

\[10.04.2025\] I elaborate on the organisation of this trip keeping in mind the other priorities in [[Summer 2025]].

\[20.06.2025\] Finally China got postponed to when the uni opens again and we decided with Nia that it is best to have her come to Italy instead of me going to Sydney, so she came here about a week ago and we are spending the first 2 weeks in Amsterdam and will get to Italy on the 6th of July, as soon as my exams are done and I will work for the [[House Choice]]. I still managed to get the MacBook Pro 14' bought by Nia in Australia at a very discounted price, I paid about 1350eur instead of the 1850eur for the same product with the student discount.
