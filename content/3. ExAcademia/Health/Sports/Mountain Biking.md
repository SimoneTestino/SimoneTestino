I began mountain biking during my [[Condensed Biography#School Years]]. I first received a mid-low level mountain bike as a gift, which I still own \[15.02.2025\], and used it for a while after moving to Switzerland in my first year. After a year, I bought a more expensive and better mountain bike, which I used for some time before selling it at a higher price (around €1600) than I bought it, as I anticipated moving to Munich where I wouldn't be able to use it for a while. Although I am still interested in mountain biking, I find renting a bike too expensive compared to buying one. If I move somewhere suitable for daily mountain biking, I would certainly consider buying a mountain bike again.
