I began spearfishing at a very early age, learning from my father. I went spearfishing frequently as a child, starting at the age of 16 when I could legally use a spearfishing gun, though before that, I used other tools. After I was able to use a gun, I continued spearfishing often, mainly during the summer. I kept up the practice every summer when I had the time, although it became less frequent once I started university.
