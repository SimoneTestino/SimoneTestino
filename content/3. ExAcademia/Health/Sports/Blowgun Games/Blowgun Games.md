Blowgun games were a tradition passed down from my father. Blowguns are aluminum tubes, approximately between 60 and 80 centimeters long, with an internal diameter of around 0.8 millimeters. For ammunitions plaster for windows is used. There are various game modes, from team-based deathmatch to others inspired by Airsoft or video games like Call of Duty. I first played blowgun games in middle school and then again in 2024 with friends in Genoa. It’s a very cheap and simple version of Airsoft; the game can be started for around five euros per person, with blowguns costing about two or three euros each, ammunition for one or two euros (enough for a day of play), and glasses or sunglasses costing around five euros. It’s a fun and inexpensive way to play.
