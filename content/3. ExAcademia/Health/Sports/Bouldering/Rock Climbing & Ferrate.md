Here is a brief list of the vie ferrate I have completed or would like to do in various areas I have visited, with those I have completed marked with the date(s).
## Genoa  
The main ferrata close to Genoa and other areas I often visit because of friends is:  
- **[Ferrata Deanna Orlandini - Reopasso Crocefieschi](https://www.ferrate365.it/en/vie-ferrate/ferrata-deanna-orlandini-reopasso-crocefieschi/)**  
  - \[25.08.2024\]  

There are a few other ferrate nearby, though they are about two hours away by car from Genoa and therefore require significantly more effort to reach:  
- **[Ferrata Artisti Bric Agnellino](https://www.ferrate365.it/vie-ferrate/ferrata-artisti-bric-agnellino/)**  
- **[Ferrata Degli Alpini Oronaye Dronero Viviere](https://www.ferrate365.it/vie-ferrate/ferrata-degli-alpini-oronaye-dronero-viviere/)**  
- **[Ferrata Della Sfinge Rocca Corvi](https://www.ferrate365.it/vie-ferrate/ferrata-della-sfinge-rocca-corvi/)**  
- **[Ferrata Mazzocchi Monte Nero Val Aveto](https://www.ferrate365.it/vie-ferrate/ferrata-mazzocchi-monte-nero-val-aveto/)** & **[Ferrata Adolfo Ferrari Roncalla](https://www.ferrate365.it/vie-ferrate/ferrata-adolfo-ferrari-roncalla/)**  
#### Falesie  
To properly go climbing in Genoa, I found [ZenaClimbing](https://www.zenaclimbing.com/), which provides an excellent listing. There is also [this guide](https://edelprino.com/migliori-falesie-provincia-di-genova-primavera-estate).
