I began bouldering in Genoa around April 2024, trying different climbing gyms. In late summer 2024, I started bouldering more intensely and frequently and went rock climbing twice shortly after (once properly rock climbing with rope and once in a [ferrata](https://www.ferrate365.it/en/vie-ferrate/ferrata-deanna-orlandini-reopasso-crocefieschi/)). When I moved to Amsterdam for my [[5th Semester]] & [[6th Semester]], I began bouldering regularly at the university gym at Science Park (next to the [[ILLC Amsterdam]]), averaging a session every two to three days. I really enjoyed it.

I give here a list of the different [[Rock Climbing & Ferrate]] I went and plan to go.
