In this folder, I collect many details about my health, particularly my [[Medical Details]] and [[Family Medical History]], in case they are needed in the future. Keeping them in one single folder is particularly important for me, as I often move countries (see [[Condensed Biography]]) and do not have a stable doctor or a state-organised archive of my medical history.

I also store notes here on my [[Sports]], both past and present, and, most importantly, I keep track of the different [[Substances]] I consume, such as [[Caffeine]], [[Melatonin]], and [[Alcohol]].
