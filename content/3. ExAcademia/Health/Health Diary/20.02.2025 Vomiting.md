On the morning of 20 February, I experienced gastrointestinal distress; I woke at 2 a.m. with vomiting and diarrhoea. I vomited only once at 2 a.m. and, approximately 30–40 minutes later, the symptoms subsided sufficiently for me to return to sleep. By the following morning, I felt considerably better.

The sauce that I prepared the previous day comprised the following ingredients:
- Potatoes (slow-cooked)
- Carrots (slow-cooked)
- Dried beans (slow-cooked)
- Heinz tomato sauce
- Albertine tomato sauce
- Mushroom champignons (slow-cooked)
- Orange cream with a vegetable aftertaste of meat

I currently have a substantial quantity of this sauce and remain uncertain as to whether I should attempt to consume it again or discard it without further consideration.

Patate e funghi da Too Good To Go al limite della scadenza, ho lavato, cotto e frullato i gambi dei funghi con le carote bollite. Nella cucina ci sono spesso escrementi di topi.
