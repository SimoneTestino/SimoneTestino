I first began to notice clear symptoms on the evening of 28 February. On the morning of 1 March, I woke up feeling noticeably unwell, with a fever peaking at 39.6°C. That same night, on 2 March, I nearly vomited, though I was unable to do so because I had not eaten beforehand. 

Regarding my food intake, on Saturday the 1st I had a simple lunch consisting of pre-cooked meat and a small amount of bread; I did not eat anything else for the rest of that day. On the 2nd, my breakfast was merely milk with chocolate. By the evening of the 3rd, I attempted to eat a small serving of mashed potatoes with carrots, but it was only at dinner on the 3rd that I managed to consume white rice with cheese without any issues. As of the 4th, I am symptom-free, although I still experience a slight loss of appetite.

The primary symptoms I experienced were a sore throat, headache, the typical discomfort associated with fever, and the near-vomiting episode; no other major symptoms were present. I also slept excessively: on the 1st, I slept for approximately 14 hours (with 11 hours during the night), and the 2nd was similar. By the night of the 3rd, although I felt somewhat better, it took me significantly longer to fall asleep, and I woke up on the 4th feeling particularly sweaty.

In terms of medication, I took paracetamol at a dose of 500 mg every 8 hours – essentially three times a day – on both the 1st and 2nd. While there were moments when the symptoms seemed to lessen, I did not notice a consistent correlation between taking the paracetamol and any relief from the symptoms.

I am uncertain about the cause of this illness. I had been out on Thursday and had met some people, though I had not been in contact with anyone for the two days prior. It is possible that this episode might be related to the incident noted on [[20.02.2025 Vomiting]].

\[08.03.2025\] I think that these days of forced resting and a lot of sleeping have in the end been really beneficiary for my mental health. I am happy I had a fever.
