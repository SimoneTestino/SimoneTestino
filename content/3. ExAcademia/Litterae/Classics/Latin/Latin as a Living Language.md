Many of us first encounter Latin in school with the traditional goal of painstakingly translating complex poetry and prose. The objective here is fundamentally different. We aim to cultivate the intuition and instinct for Latin that one has for a living, spoken language. The method begins by building this foundational sense, allowing us to gradually approach and read sophisticated texts not as a puzzle to be decoded, but as a language we genuinely understand. Through this approach, the goal is to truly **know** Latin.

### Foundational Tools
To begin this journey, we'll rely on two primary resources. The foundational textbook is Hans Ørberg's *[Familia Romana](https://amzn.eu/d/hqfaxG8)*, which masterfully introduces grammar and vocabulary in a natural, prioritised order. For a vast collection of original texts, our main digital repository will be [The Latin Library](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com). They provide also great supplementary materials on grammar and vocabulary found in resources like [Latin 101](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/ll1/) and [Latin 102](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/ll2/).
### Starting Point: The Clarity of Neo-Latin
After completing *Familia Romana*, the most effective next step is to dive into reading original texts. We'll start not with the classics, but with authors from the [Neo-Latin period](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/neo.html). In this era, Latin functioned much as English does today: as a universal language for science, philosophy, and culture. Its grammar was often simplified for clarity, making these works remarkably accessible for a learner.

### Recommended Neo-Latin Authors
Here are some excellent authors to begin with, all available on The Latin Library:
* **Philosophy & Political Thought**
    * [René Descartes](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/des.html): His philosophical meditations are a cornerstone of modern thought.
    * [Francis Bacon](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bacon/): A key figure in the scientific revolution.
    * [Baruch Spinoza](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/spinoza.html): His *Ethica* is a monumental work.
    * [Thomas More](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/more.html): Author of *Utopia*.
    * [Karl Marx](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/marx.html): His doctoral dissertation was written in Latin.
* **Science**
    * [Galileo Galilei](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/galileo/galileo.sid.html): Read his astronomical observations in his own words.
    * [Isaac Newton](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/newton.html): Selections from his groundbreaking *Principia Mathematica*.
* **Literature**
    * [Dante Alighieri](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/dante.html): His Latin prose, like *[De vulgari eloquentia](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/dante/vulgar.shtml)*, is a great entry point. The [Princeton Dante Project](https://dante.princeton.edu/) is an excellent resource for his works.

### Advancing to the Classics
Once a comfortable intuition is established with later texts, you can confidently turn to the classical period. While generally more complex, your foundation in Neo-Latin will make the transition much smoother. Certain authors provide a good bridge to this more ancient style.

### Accessible Classical Authors
For your first foray into classical Latin, consider these authors:
* **Prose:** [Gaius Iulius Caesar](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/caesar/) is the traditional starting point for his clear and direct style.
* **Poetry:** The works of [Catullus](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/catullus.shtml) and [Ovid](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/ovid.html) are often more approachable than those of their contemporaries.
