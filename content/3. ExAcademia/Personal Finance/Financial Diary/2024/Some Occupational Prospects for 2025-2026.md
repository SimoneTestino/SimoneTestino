Given the not particularly exciting outcomes from the [[PhD Applications Results]], the question of what to do next year remains open. I've been exploring several possibilities, starting from the initial thoughts in [[Notes on China]], which eventually led to the [[Two Weeks Seminar in Beijing]] and the holiday with Nia documented in [[Beijing and Sydney]].

At the moment, I see two main paths forward:

1. **Find a [[Some Occupational Prospects for 2025-2026#PhD Positions]]** — If I find a suitable position, I could start the programme and evaluate how well it fits over the first year. If the project turns out not to be a good match, I could apply to other [[PhD Applications]] by mid-year. If I do enjoy the work, I might commit more fully to that project and have a stable position until the end of the contract.

2. **Enter the job market** (in [[Some Occupational Prospects for 2025-2026#Education]] or [[Some Occupational Prospects for 2025-2026#Finance]]) — Alternatively, I could spend the year working in a company. This would allow me to contribute meaningfully to my [[Personal Finance]] and strengthen my [[Curriculum_Vitae_Professional.pdf]] with additional experience outside academia.

I use this page to list and compare different options that could turn out to be valuable paths forward. Here, I focus on details that may not necessarily be relevant for the long-term prospects of my academic career, which I still plan to pursue. However, following the [[Motivational Decline]], I value the idea of taking a break for a year from the academic pressures I’ve experienced over the past three years (see [[Bachelors' Outline]] & [[Master's Outline]]). During this time, I want to shift my focus to the more professional and financial aspects of life, keeping my options open. 

What I foresee is that the less stimulating and academically interesting I find a position, the more motivated I will become to pursue [[PhD Applications]] again, avoiding the [[PhD Applications Regrets]]. My ultimate goal remains securing a favourable and appealing PhD position.
