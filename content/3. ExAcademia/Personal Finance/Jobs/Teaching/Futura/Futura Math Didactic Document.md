Between the 07.03.2025 and 12.03.2025 I have worked on a document commissioned by [[Futura]] for the training of students preparing for the oral exam. I save the code comprehending all material in [[Futura Manuale Aereonautica Marzo]], which is kept private due to the agreement signed with Futura.

Right after, I have then been assigned a second job [[Futura Manuale Esercito Marzo]], of the same form of the former and with similar retribution which I did between the 13.03.2025 and the 19.03.2025. 

In total for the first job I wrote 114 pages and for the second 122 new pages, in the second one I used some parts from the previous job. I saved all data on the documents in [Spreadsheet: Futura Document Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RlrBk0Y4nBUo-FvXwBSUeQsYiN3-3fdeCY3Ao2ZHMfU/edit?usp=sharing). The retribution was of 10€ per page, totalling 2360€ in about 8 days of part time work, while still doing most of the assignment for university, quite a satisfaction.
