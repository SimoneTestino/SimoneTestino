As soon as the [[PhD Applications Results]] are released and I have reviewed the legal details concerning the country where I will be living, I will use the [[Job Offer]] page to find the right employee for the [[Cleaning Services for Rental Margin]] project.

## Payment Methods
This section provides more detailed information than that offered in the [[Job Offer]] about how the [[Employee]] can be compensated for their work. All details are still subject to the note in [[Cleaning Services for Rental Margin#Nothing more than a Sketch]].

##### Salary vs Shared Profits
The employee could choose between two payment methods. A significant portion of their income will certainly include rent and food, which are provided for free and considered non-taxable income. However, the actual cash payment can take two forms, depending on the level of risk the employee is willing to accept. The less risky option is receiving a fixed monthly amount, as outlined in the [[Job Offer]]. 

Alternatively, the employee can opt for a shared profits arrangement from the household's income, which could potentially increase their earnings but also comes with higher risk. The percentage of shared profits will be negotiated and will not depend on the employee's input in each activity, ensuring that it does not exceed one-third higher than the agreed fixed salary. This method would incentivise the employee to maximise the household's profitability, benefiting both parties.

##### Rest of Expenses
Another variable component of the employee's income could come from the remaining balance of the household's daily expenses, primarily for food. This approach would encourage the employee to minimise expenses while ensuring that any complaints about quality are taken seriously. Despite this cost-effective behaviour, all expenses will still be meticulously tracked, as outlined in [[Employee Admission Process#Numerical Literacy]].
