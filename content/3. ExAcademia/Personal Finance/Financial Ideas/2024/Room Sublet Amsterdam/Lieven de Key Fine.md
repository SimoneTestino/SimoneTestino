### Update 21.12
After being caught by the dorm due to the [[Sublet admin]], I was summoned to meet with “Juliette Geraedts - Gunning Teamleider Studentenhuisvesting.” Following a lengthy moral lecture that had little impact on me (see [[Ethics as Aesthetics]]), she informed me that I would have to pay the fine as stipulated in the contract, which, as I already knew, states:
	1.5.      The Rented Property is intended for the accommodation of students or PhD students as specified in Section 274d, subsection 2 of Book 7 of the Netherlands Civil Code and Section 274e, subsection 2 of Book 7 of the Netherlands Civil Code. On termination of this Lease, the accommodation will again be rented out to a student or PhD student. Furthermore, the Rented Property is intended solely to serve as accommodation for the Tenant. The latter must personally occupy the Rented Property on a continuous basis. The Tenant is prohibited from offering all or part of the Rented Property and/or allow any third parties to occupy the Property. This also means the Tenant is expressly prohibited from offering or letting the Rented Property on websites (including, but not limited to, Airbnb and Couchsurfing). In the event of a violation of this prohibition, the Tenant will be required to pay the lessor an immediately due and payable fine of € 100 per day, subject to a maximum of € 10,000, notwithstanding the lessor’s right to full compensation.

I later received an email stating that I had to pay €1400 in fines, despite having declared that guests stayed for only 8 nights and explaining in detail why this claim was plausible. I then asked for clarification regarding the specific amount. After about 20 days, I received a brief response listing 14 different keyfriends, including some whom we had reasonably agreed were unlikely to have paid.

Currently \[21.12.24\] I have not received the formal request to pay the fine, since I should receive it by email as stated in a previous email sent by Juliette on the 26th November:
	We will book this amount in your contract and will send you a separate link to pay via email.

I currently \[21.12.24\] still have to receive this link and will not proceed with the discussion on the amount until I have reason to believe that they didn't just forget about the fine.

Still \[02.02.2025\] no fine, they seem to just have forgotten about it.
