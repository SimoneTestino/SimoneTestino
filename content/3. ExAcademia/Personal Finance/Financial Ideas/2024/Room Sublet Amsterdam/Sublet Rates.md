This page provides all the necessary information regarding the payment options for your stay. Below you find details on rates for single and double guests, as well as special rates for specific periods. Payment options are listed at the end.
## 💰 Deposit
A €200 deposit is required, it can be paid upon arrival once you are sure that the room satisfies your expectations but paying it in advance is the _only_ way to be assured that a spot in the room will be reserved for you. The deposit will be refunded at the end of your stay, provided no damage is done to the room. Do not forget to send a copy of your documents, Identity Document or Passport to me before and to wait for my approval _before_ sending the deposit. 

Keep always in mind that the deposit guarantees me that you will come in the reserved dates, that is, after the deposit is paid, those _cannot change_ or the deposit may not be completely (or at all, in case of cancellation) refunded.
## 💵 Rates
Here are the prices for the short term, they vary on the amount of nights you book and people that stay, you are encouraged to invite friends to lower the prices! For the **Long Term** the price is always about 600€/month though it depends on many factors and for specifics you need to contact me.

Any amount of cash above 50€ is not accepted for safety reasons (or on individual basis, if you need to pay cash ask me in advance, it won't be otherwise accepted). Also Paypal payments above 10€ are not accepted if the customer does not reserve to pay the respective fees, around 4% of the total sum.

Cash payments over 50€ are accepted for the deposit only if the guest agrees on the schedule constrains for the pay-back. If that does not fit and/or the guest checks out later than planned, it will result in a detraction from the deposit of 15€.
