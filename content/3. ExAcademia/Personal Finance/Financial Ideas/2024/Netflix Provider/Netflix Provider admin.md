Here I store all financial details on the Netflix Provider project.
### Start
The basic idea of the project is for me to pay subscriptions monthly to Netflix and allow students living in student dorms to use these accounts in exchange of a monthly subscription, the profits come solely from the margin I make in the difference of the positive and negative cashflows.

This plan applies particularly well to student dorms, since they all have the exact same WiFi connection and hence the same IP-address and count, for the Netflix's new policies, as one single household. These Netflix policies in fact allow me to have less competition (i.e. not from online platforms) and hence greater margins.
##### I. Planning
There are numbers data I need to fix first:
- which Netflix subscription
- how many people per subscription
- how much should everyone pay
I answer those questions in the following paragraphs:

**Netflix Subscriptions** Among the three offered subscriptions, it is a trivial conclusion that most margins will come out of the Premium one, even if the watch-quality were the same. It allows me in fact to have _4 devices_ watching at the same time and _6_ devices to which _downloads_ are allowed! The cost of the subscription amounts to 19€ monthly.

**People per Subscription** The choice of the Premium account allows me both to increase prices, since the quality is higher than the one offered by the comparable alternatives, and to have more people using the same account. I examine the maximal and minimal case: 

_Minimal Case_: for best comfort, one is to split costs in 4 people and have access to the account always guaranteed.

_Maximal Case_: to still have access always guaranteed, one could download the films and then turn internet off the device while watching them. This would allow 6 people to watch from downloads and 4 people to watch streaming. That is 10 people per account still having guaranteed access.

_Middle Case_: for now I restrict the options to a middle case, so that people can almost always watch in streaming and do not need to turn off the internet from the device; though there may be cheaper subscriptions in the future that have such a constrain. So I decide for now to have _6 people per account_.

**Income per Customer** In later stages, I will consider different payment methods (monthly & yearly with some free months and discounts). For now, I want to have a simplified model that does not require me any initial investment (like free initial months). In order to keep a moderate margin and have a good looking number, I will ask for _4.90€_ a month.

These conditions result in the following numbers per account per month:
- _cash-in_: $4.90 \cdot 6 = 29.40$€
- _cash-out_: $18.99$€
- _margin_: $10.01$€, $36.40\%$
##### II. Trials
To begin the practical side, I want to do a trial within my dorm. There is a group-chat that currently has 32 members of the 40 residents of my dorm. I plan there to send a message in which I present the project as just a sharing of the same plan I will use. I will therefore not even share the page "[[Netflix Sharing]]", but instead send a very easy message in which I ask people to share the account with me. Here is the message I plan to send: <br>
	Hii! I’m planning to get _Netflix Premium_ and share it with a few other students of the dorm. Since we’re all on the same Wi-Fi, we can be considered one household for Netflix and easily share the account. The cost would be *€4.90/month* for the 4K version with no ads – way better than paying _€8.99_ solo for ads and 720p.
	If you are interested dm me and we can create the account together!

I would be happy to have one functioning account out of this. No matter how this first experiment go, I will get some people from the [[Social Network#Master of Logic (Network)]] who will give me access to try the same in different dorms (most under Lieven de Key, just as mine).

These trial phase will smoothly turn into a more serious phase as soon as I am satisfying a sufficient demand, which could be at around 5 active accounts, profiting 50€ monthly.

##### III. Legal & Policies
As soon as the profits get non-negligible, I will need to be aware of the legal consequences of my actions, since the increase in profits will also increase the chances to attract the inspection of authorities. I will need then to answer the following questions:
- Are consequences only civil (i.e. only fines) in the Netherlands, no matter the size of the business?
- Check the amount of each fine and guess the chances of getting caught; compare it then to the profits and growth.

#### IV. Netflix Sharing Policy
I will need first to check that the sharing alternatives are not possible, i.e. the sharing impairment that Netflix imposed is actually working in all areas I want to be active in (i.e., to start, the Netherlands). I will need as much data as possible on the actions Netflix is taking to impair abusive sharing. Most of the needed information should be public in the quarterly report.

Assuming that these two last steps do not prevent me to continue and that, despite the potential fines or inefficient policies, I am incentivated to make the business grow, I will then proceed simultaneously with step IV. and V.
#### V. Attractive Pricings
There are two kind of discounts I can offer to students in order to get new customers: (i) those aimed in convincing the customer to join at a first time and stay if satisfied and (ii) those aimed at making the customer bring new customers. On top of that, (iii) there are discounts aimed at keeping the current and new clients, like lower prices for longer subscriptions. 
%%Here are some proposals, numbers are not exposed yet since they depend on the expected growth which I will estimate at a later stage:
- _Free Beginning_: I offer to the client not to pay the first months%%
#### VI. _Geographical_ Growth
The nature of the business plan restricts me strongly on a _geographical_ level, in the sense that I will need a direct contact to someone within a dorm, in order to sponsor my offer. Depending on [[Netflix Provider admin#Start#III. Legal & Policies]], I will also consider to sponsor the business in more open ways, rather than within group-chats of the student dorms, e.g. posters in the university.

As long as there seems to be no competitor and the [[Netflix Provider admin#III. Legal & Policies]] do not bound me too much, there is no limit to growth, demand will probably be high

%%Risk analysis, different pricing and downloads isntead of streaming, expansion speed...%%

### 📊 Alternatives
If you’re considering alternatives, Netflix offers a **Standard Plan with Ads** at **$8.99/month**.

- **💸💸💸 Price**: **$8.99/month** (basic plan).

- **720p HD 👾**: This resolution is significantly lower than 4K Ultra HD. For context, 4K Ultra HD (3840 x 2160 pixels) offers approximately 16 times the resolution of 720p HD (1280 x 720 pixels), providing much clearer and more detailed images.

- **Advertisements 📢**: About 4-5 minutes of ads per hour, with ads ranging from 15 to 30 seconds. They may appear both before and during shows or movies.

With our plan, you get superior quality and no interruptions—definitely a more compelling choice!

### 📍 Why Exclusively for the Student Dorm?
The reason this offer is limited to residents of the student dorm is that Netflix’s policy restricts account sharing to members of the same household. Since we are all in the same student dorm and share the same IP address, we are permitted to share the account among different apartments within the dorm, but not with individuals outside of it.

### 📋 Rules
1. **Account Access**: I will provide the email and password for the Netflix account.
2. **No Sharing**: Please do not share the email and password with others. I can monitor the devices logged in from Netflix settings, so only you will have access to the credentials.
3. **Multiple Devices**: You can log in on as many devices as you like, but remember, only one person gets the email and password to ensure the account remains secure.
4. **Payment**: Payment can be made monthly. You can choose from the following options:
   - **PayPal**: [https://www.paypal.me/simonetestino](https://www.paypal.me/simonetestino)
   - **Bank Transfer**: Here are the details for a direct bank transfer:
     - **Account Holder**: Simone Testino
     - **IBAN**: IT94I0338501601100080084122
     - **BIC/SWIFT**: ISYBITMM
     - **Bank Name**: Isybank by Intesa San Paolo, Italy
