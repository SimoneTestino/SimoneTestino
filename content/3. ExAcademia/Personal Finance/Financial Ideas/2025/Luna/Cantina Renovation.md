In short, we plan to renovate a Catina in Genoa and use it as a basis for the construction of the first Luna and for storing of the required materials.
> [!Note] Allowance Requested
>  All plans below assume prior approval from the property owners (my grandparents) and the administrator of the cellar complex. These interventions are necessary to prepare the space for the initial phases of Luna production and to optimize regional shipping and operations in Northern Italy.

### Dehumidifier & Climate Comfort
A programmable dehumidifier (with built-in humidistat) will maintain optimal humidity and run only when needed. It should allow for direct drainage into an external basin for extended use. For temperature regulation, either a dehumidifier with integrated heating/cooling ("Pinguino"-style) or a separate electric heater/cooling fan will be used, based on budget. Target models for smart dehumidifiers are in the €80–€120 range, with temperature control addons if needed.
### Door Insulation Upgrade
The existing door will be improved to minimize drafts and humidity ingress. This includes purchasing a wooden or plastic panel (€10–20) for reinforcement, adding insulating foam (€20–30), and installing a black rubber sealing strip (door gasket, €10–15) to ensure an airtight closure. These upgrades are crucial for blocking air leaks, improving climate control, and reducing energy consumption.
### Ceiling Treatment
For the ceiling (15 sqm of bare bricks), a breathable dehumidifying plaster (lime-based) will be applied to prevent humidity, improve aesthetics, and stop dust or debris from falling. After plastering, a mineral, vapor-permeable paint will be applied for a durable, healthy finish. All surfaces should be cleaned and protected before beginning. Only basic tools (trowel, float, bucket) are required—but these are already available—and protective sheets are not needed. Adequate drying time should be allowed between plastering and painting.
