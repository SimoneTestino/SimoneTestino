Another source of income that needs to be mentioned among the [[Business Segments]] is the long term rental, with that we mean any income (or share of expenses) that is generated by the renting out of the bedrooms and common areas alone. This can be split into three different branches:
- [[Remote Work Rental]], requiring a good [[Smart Home#Internet Connection]]
- [[Holiday Rental]]
- [[Volunteers#Shared Expenses]] with [[Volunteers]], i.e. food and utilities

I expand the methods to advertise and the compatibility of these businesses with the other [[Business Segments]] in the dedicated pages.
