The [[Business]] that funds the [[Coliving Liguria]] project is split in three parts, here I briefly present them and give the links to the pages of each.
- [[Event Hosting]], 18th Birthdays, New-year party and similar will be hosted in the spacious tavern 
- [[Airbnb]], one to three private bedrooms are going to be offered on airbnb
- [[Pet Hotel]], nearby pet owners can leave their pets to us which will be taken care of

It is important to note that both the [[Airbnb]] and the [[Pet Hotel]] are mainly seasonal businesses and that only the [[Event Hosting]] can be practiced during the whole year. Furthermore, I go deeper into the analysis of the three businesses and how they compare in the [Income Partition Prospect](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GKwLcnvUsbAAlHqGw_WOQRSy3WQQjMlu?usp=sharing).
