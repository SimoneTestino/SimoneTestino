### June 2025
- **4th**. A friend of mine who works in the field is going to visit the house trying to address the major concerns (see [questions](https://www.overleaf.com/read/msmhfvttdwnw#00ac62)) which will lower the necessary hard [[Renovation Work]].
- **12th**. I have an estimate of the costs for the [[Renovation Work#Roof]], if too high the [[House Choice]] may have significant modifications and so the rest of the calendar.
- **16.06 - 04.07**. Busy due to exams for my [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]].
### July 2025
- **6th**. The house hunt will begin, I will be visiting houses on a daily basis determining the best option for the [[House Choice]]. In the meantime I will be able to offer 2 - 3 [[Volunteers#Volunteer Offer]] for the renovation.
- **Day 1**. As soon as the [[House Choice]] has been completed, i.e. my offer has been accepted, I will be able to send all [[Volunteers#Volunteer Offer]] that I can organise. I have strong preference for the *Day 1* to be in July, in case of [[House Choice#Buying at Auction]] it may be delayed to August or early September with the compromise of a potentially bigger house.
