We can divide the tasks that are most crucial to the project into two major sections: the first concerns the [[Renovation Work]], while the second pertains to the [[Business Segments]] that generate revenue for the project. A few remaining tasks involve general cleaning, maintenance of the house, and cooking.

During both the initial phase and the ongoing development of the project, the most critical tasks will fall under the [[Renovation Work]], which can be divided into four areas of the property: the [[Apartment]], [[Exteriors]], [[Garden]], and the [[Tavern]]. Each of these areas will include lighter tasks, such as [[Doors Renovation]], as well as more demanding undertakings like the complete renovation of the [[Tavern]] or the installation of [[Thermal Insulation]].

To finance the purchase of raw materials for the [[Renovation Work]], it will be beneficial to maintain an ongoing [[Business]] structured around three main [[Business Segments]]: [[Event Hosting]], [[Airbnb]], and [[Pet Hotel]]. These primarily involve lighter duties, such as transporting customers, cleaning up after events, changing bed linen, or preparing food for pets.

Importantly, more intellectual skills are greatly welcomed! For those that are skilled in Art & Design can give crucial inputs on how to make the whole appearance of the house much better and hence get greater success on [[Airbnb]] and [[Event Hosting]]. All [[Business Segments]] are in fact also going to need advertisement and both in person sponsoring and socials are going to be a necessary component. For those skilled in STEM, you may want to check out [[Luna]] the manufacturing startup which will lay its foundations within this house.
