I use this page to present the project I am currently working on, which involves purchasing a house in the Ligurian hills, near where I was born, and renovating it with the help of volunteers who wish to enjoy some time in nature and contribute to the development of a small business there. I will undertake this project as a short break from my studies in the [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]], while also continuing to work on my [[Master Thesis]]. 

The aim of this page is to share the progress of the house purchase and renovation with everyone involved, as well as with anyone who is curious or seeking inspiration from the project. This page also serves as a tool to organise all relevant details, documents, links, and reflections concerning the house renovation and business ideas. In particular, it offers an overview of the project for potential [[Volunteers]] who may wish to take part.

This page is the entry point to a larger folder, divided into the following three main sections:
- [[3. ExAcademia/Personal Finance/Coliving Liguria/House/House]], where I detail the [[Renovation Work]]
- [[Involved People]], particularly the [[Volunteers]]
- [[Business]], where I outline the three [[Business Segments]]

You can browse through these pages to explore all aspects of the project and the house.
