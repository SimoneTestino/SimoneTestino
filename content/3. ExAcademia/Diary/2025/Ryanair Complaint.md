### 4. Legal Basis and Final Notice of Legal Action

Our legal position is unequivocal and based on established international and European law.

* **Governing Law**: The claim is governed by the **Montreal Convention of 1999**, as incorporated into European Union law through Regulation (EC) No 2027/97 (as amended by Regulation No 889/2002).
* **Carrier Liability**: Pursuant to **Article 17(2)** of the Convention, the air carrier is liable for damage to checked baggage.
* **Rejection of Receipt Demand**: Your request for a purchase receipt is legally invalid as a precondition for settling this claim.
    * The **Montreal Convention does not legally obligate a passenger to produce an original purchase receipt**. The convention is the supreme governing law in this matter, superseding any internal airline policy.
    * Demanding a receipt for an item purchased **over six years prior** is an unreasonable and obstructive tactic designed to impede a valid claim.
    * The value of the damaged item has been reasonably and transparently established through the current market valuation of a comparable model, which is a legally sound and accepted method of proof.
* **Final Warning**: Any further delay or refusal to pay will be considered a definitive breach of your legal obligations. We are prepared to initiate immediate legal proceedings through the **European Small Claims Procedure** (Regulation (EC) No 861/2007) without any further notice.

### 5. Justification of Claimed Amount

* **Damaged Item**: A full-suspension mountain bike with a full aluminum frame, featuring a rear coil shock absorber, a front coil fork, and hydraulic disc brakes.
* **Requested Compensation**: **€950**.
* **Value Attestation**: This figure represents the fair market replacement value for a bicycle of similar technical specifications. A comparable model, the Rockrider ST 540 S, currently retails for approximately €999. The amount claimed is not the original purchase price but a realistic, depreciated value adjusted from the original purchase currency (Swiss Francs - CHF).
