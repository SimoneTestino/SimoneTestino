Since I apparently sort of fell in love with Alexandra, I am moving to Prague for some time. Since I am going there, it may be worth it to do something cool. Other than finding the room/studio and the right plane, which I am organising in these days, I am also trying to have some activities organised. First of all it'd be super cool (and probably nice to do around Alex), to organise a Latin club, following [[Latin as a Living Language]]. Secondly, I want to see if there is anything that they do at the University of Prague that matches well my [[Research Areas]] and, more importantly, I should try to apply for the position in [Research Year in AI](https://www.cs.cas.cz/job-offer/Graduate-research-assistant-position-Neruda-2025/en).

## Latin Group 
I will begin with an email to the relevant professors in the faculty of humanities:

> Dear Professor [Professor's Last Name],
>
> I'm a student at the ILLC in Amsterdam, studying Formal Philosophy and Mathematical Logic. I'm writing to you on a very different note, however, as I'm very interested in classical languages, despite them being quite far from my academic focus.
>
> During my high school program in Italy, I followed the five-year curriculum in Latin and Greek grammar and literature that is part of the *Liceo Classico*. Ever since then, I've wanted to deepen my knowledge of these languages in a more alternative way. I always found it frustrating to learn all the rules and declensions by heart, yet never quite be able to form a sentence as I could in other foreign languages. Around that time, I learned about methods for approaching classical languages as if they were living ones—probably not the most efficient way to dissect a complex passage in Tacitus, but definitely a very fun one.
>
> Clearly, properly learning a language is a social activity. However, unlike with modern languages, it’s not always easy to find Latin speakers, and let's just say the local clergy aren't always the most entertaining company for a chat over a beer. I wanted, therefore, to ask if you might be willing to share this email with any students who you think would be passionate about learning Latin and/or Greek as a living language by forming a small study group.
>
> I've compiled a list of materials I was thinking of using, which you can see here: https://simonetestino.pages.dev/3.-ExAcademia/Litterae/Classics/Latin/Latin-as-a-Living-Language. I should also add that since I don't have a definite plan for how long I'll be in Prague, I see this as an initial experiment. The first step is just to see if there are actually people interested and to get the group started; we can then figure out how things develop from there.
>
> Thank you for your time.
>
> Kind regards,

I should forward the email to: [Institute for Greek and Latin Studies](https://urls.ff.cuni.cz/en/academic-staff/) at Charles University.
