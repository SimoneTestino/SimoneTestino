I collect in this page all pages in which I write sporadic thoughts on different themes that are usually related to the specific time in which I am writing them or are not formed ideas yet to constitute a proper page. I divide these diary notes into different folders depending on the topic, in particular I have an [[Academic Diary]] and a [[Financial Diary]]. On this page I only collect some other remaining notes, some of them may not be published. The years always refer to the academic year starting in September and ending in August.
