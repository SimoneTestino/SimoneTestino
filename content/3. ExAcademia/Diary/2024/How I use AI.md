In this page, I want to outline the different ways I use AI. The first and most frequent use is rewriting texts to make the language more natural and polished, allowing me to write more efficiently. The second use is assistance in mathematical proofs—when working on exercises or familiarising myself with new vocabulary and definitions, AI is a convenient tool for constructing and verifying proofs. Lastly, I use AI to help with presentations, often by dictating content and iterating on modifications.  

## Rewriting Texts for Clarity and Efficiency  

I initially started using ChatGPT mainly to rephrase emails. However, from the very beginning, I also experimented with using it to rewrite texts I had already written. This significantly changed the way I approach technical and low-level writing.  

By "low-level writing," I mean writing like this, where I simply need to express a straightforward concept. Technical writing, on the other hand, does not necessarily require more complex synthesis than low-level writing; it merely employs technical terms that are well known to ChatGPT and fall within its accessible vocabulary.  

For both technical and low-level writing, I rely almost entirely on ChatGPT. I usually provide the structure of the text myself but do not concern myself with word choice, punctuation, or stylistic refinements. In the same way that I do not worry about handwriting, I do not worry about selecting words when writing technical or simple texts. This also applies when switching languages—for example, writing in Italian if I prefer, rather than in English. Sometimes, I take this approach even further, as in this very note: I am dictating it in Italian and letting ChatGPT translate and refine it into English.  

This approach applies broadly, whether for emails, various notes on this site, or even more technical texts such as essays. Ever since I started using ChatGPT, this rewriting process has been a constant part of my workflow.  

A more recent way in which I use ChatGPT is for taking notes efficiently. This has been particularly useful in allowing me to put into writing many thoughts that I would otherwise not document because it would take too long to write them out manually.  

For example, even in this note, the benefit is not particularly striking. However, if I can write something down in just a couple of minutes by dictating while doing something else—such as preparing a snack—it becomes worth the effort. On the other hand, if it required significantly more time and effort, I might not have written it at all.  
## AI-Assisted Presentations  

Another major way I use AI is for creating presentations. Many of the presentations I prepare are done by dictating content and iterating with ChatGPT to refine the structure and wording. This process is especially useful for generating structured explanations, summarising key points, and ensuring clarity.  Examples are most presentation I wrote in the last years, like those for [[Futura Military]]. but also those for [[Forcing (Research Project)]] and several other examples.

## Assistance in Mathematical Proofs  

In many cases, when working on exercises or trying to familiarise myself with new definitions and terminology, AI can be a useful tool for constructing and verifying proofs. It allows me to quickly test ideas, check the correctness of arguments, and gain insights into alternative approaches. The most recent and shocking example is [[Introduction to Modal Logic (Lecture)]], in particular the document: [Overleaf: Final Exam's Solutions](https://www.overleaf.com/read/xkskcjnbhcjk#e9e8fa).

## Finding Relevant Literature with AI  

Another significant way I use AI is for finding academic literature on topics that interest me, especially when there are numerous references or when I lack a starting point. For topics with established reference points, tools like [SEP]([https://plato.stanford.edu](https://plato.stanford.edu/)), [nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage) or [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia) can be incredibly useful for gathering initial insights.  

However, when I don't have a specific reference or an academic network to turn to, asking ChatGPT for suggestions is a fantastic alternative. ChatGPT can help me identify relevant academic papers or resources, even offering suggestions for directions I might not have considered.  

This is particularly valuable when I encounter papers that I’m unsure I’ll be able to fully understand. One of the advantages of having my personal website is that ChatGPT can access it and directly inform me whether a particular paper is within my comprehension range (see [[Why a Website?]]). Additionally, it can recommend which courses or past papers I’ve read are most relevant to the paper I’m planning to study, helping me to better prepare and focus my reading.

\[17.02.2025\] An exercise that ChatGPT couldn't do is the 1.c of the Final Exam 2024 in  [Overleaf: Final Exam's Solutions](https://www.overleaf.com/read/xkskcjnbhcjk#e9e8fa), I tried many times and asking to some other AIs too, but they couldn't come up with an answer.
