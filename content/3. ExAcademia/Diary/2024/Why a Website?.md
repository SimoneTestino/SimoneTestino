I originally conceived this website as an extension of my curriculum vitae, inspired by my habit of taking detailed notes on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). While compiling extensive notes on each course I followed, I sought to publish these details in a manner that allowed others to appreciate the depth of my academic journey. By linking these notes directly to my [[Curriculum Vitae.pdf]], I aimed to present my work in the most comprehensive and transparent way possible.

As the project evolved, I gradually incorporated additional components. Notably, I added a [[Personal Finance]] section to the site—not only to share insights with friends but also to explore an aspect of my life that I approach with a game-like mentality. For instance, my note [[Money as a Game]] reflects how I currently treat money as an engaging challenge rather than an ultimate goal.

A significant motivation behind maintaining such a detailed online presence is the convenience it offers. I regularly take notes on various subjects, whether they pertain to academic ideas or organisational details, much like an [[Academic Diary]]. This practice not only helps me stay organised but also enriches my record of experiences.

Furthermore, by making these data publicly available, I can receive highly personalised responses from artificial intelligence. For example, I can query AI about whether a particular paper is comprehensible, how it relates to other works I have read, or even which courses might be most beneficial to deepen my understanding of that paper. The site, with its comprehensive repository of my academic readings, comments, course details, and financial insights, enables such customised advice, thereby enhancing both my academic and financial decision-making.

In conclusion, this website serves as a multifaceted tool—initially born out of the desire to expand my curriculum, it has grown into a platform that not only documents my academic progress but also facilitates engaging explorations into financial strategies. The resulting blend of meticulous note-taking and AI-assisted insights makes this endeavour an invaluable resource for my personal and professional development.
