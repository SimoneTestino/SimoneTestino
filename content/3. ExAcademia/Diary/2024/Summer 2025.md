In this note, I thoroughly plan my summer 2025 to ensure that all necessary tasks fit within the available months. I begin by discussing the major tasks that must be completed and the order in which they should be addressed. Afterwards, I provide a month-by-month breakdown of the plan, which you can find below.

First, I establish the boundaries of summer. I have my final exam on the 28th May at 17:00, sitting the exam in [[Model Theory, ILLC (Lecture)]]. Summer will end when I secure a PhD position and/or find a job (see [[Some Occupational Prospects for 2025-2026]]). Since I must schedule tasks during these days, yet cannot reliably predict news regarding prospects for the next academic year, I adopt conservative assumptions. Specifically, I assume that by the 1st September I will have submitted the [[Master Thesis]] and be prepared to move to another continent. With this in mind, I plan the period from the 28th May until the 1st September.

To begin, here are the main tasks and partial plans I currently have:
- Most importantly, I need to finish the [[Master Thesis]] in order to be able to enrol in any potential [[Some Occupational Prospects for 2025-2026#PhD Positions]].
- Secondly, I have a wonderful opportunity to participate in the partially funded [[Two Weeks Seminar in Beijing]], which would complement the [[Beijing and Sydney]] trip. This commitment would not prevent me from studying intensively, since both locations provide excellent environments for focused work.
- Additionally, I must organise the move of all my belongings from Amsterdam to Genoa. This task will require considerable time and effort, and it must be completed before the 23rd June, which is the final day of my contract in Amsterdam. In particular, I need to address the logistics regarding my bike, as it will be both more complicated and expensive to move.
- Furthermore, if I get unsatisfactory marks in the exams, I might have one or more of the following resits:
  - [[Structures for Semantics (Lecture)]]: 26.06.2025
  - [[Model Theory, ILLC (Lecture)]]: 30.06.2025
  - [[Rudiments in Set Theory (Lecture)]]: 04.07.2025
- Finally, I would like to determine the optimal date to confirm the [[Beijing and Sydney]] trip. The potential need to resit any of the exams listed above could cause significant delays in booking flights. Even in the worst-case scenario, where I must resit [[Rudiments in Set Theory (Lecture)]] on the 04.07.2025, I would still be able to commence the trip from that date.
#### Fixing the Dates for Sydney & Beijing
Before planning month by month, I consider some general time constraints. The dates I can stay for free in Sydney are already known, which means the [[Beijing and Sydney]] dates are partially set. The free period in Sydney is from 30.06.2025 at 10:00 to 24.07.2025 at 07:00. This opens up two possible two-week time slots for Beijing:
- **Before Sydney**: From 16.06.2025 to 30.06.2025.
- **After Sydney**: From 24.07.2025 to 07.08.2025.

There are significant disadvantages to the first option. Firstly, there is a potential clash with the resit exams (if the hotel is booked by the university, requesting changes might be complicated). Secondly, I need to ensure that the project I will present (either my [[Master Thesis]] or [[Forcing on Urelements (Research Project)]]) is at an advanced stage before leaving. By contrast, if I depart for China afterwards, I will have ample time during my stay in Sydney to prepare. Lastly, opting for the second set of dates would also ensure that I have already purchased the [[Buying MacBook Air 15 inch]], which will make working without a monitor considerably easier. Consequently, I conclude that it is best to depart for Sydney around the very beginning of July and travel to Beijing from 24.07.2025 until 07.08.2025.
##### On When to Buy the Tickets
To determine the optimal date for purchasing tickets, two factors must be considered. First, I need to be confident that I can commit to the trip on the confirmed dates. Second, I must ensure that the tickets are bought during a period when flight prices are lower. According to available data, buying tickets between three and six weeks in advance tends to yield the lowest prices (as detailed in [[Beijing and Sydney#Combined Trip to China and Sydney]]). The only variable is the resit dates for the three exams mentioned earlier. An undesired mark in either [[Model Theory, ILLC (Lecture)]] or [[Rudiments in Set Theory (Lecture)]] could result in a delay of one or five days respectively. I expect to have the results three to seven days after the exams, as the [[Rudiments in Set Theory (Lecture)]] exam will be on 23.05.2025 and the [[Model Theory, ILLC (Lecture)]] exam on 28.05.2025. Therefore, I should be able to purchase the tickets with just under a month's notice. Alternatively, if I decide it is more convenient, given the [[Track of the MSc. Logic]], I may buy the tickets in advance and then replace the exam with another when selecting the track in linguistics.
### Plan by Month
Below is a summary of the plan for each month. For each month, I first list the tasks I aim to accomplish, then detail the precise sequence and dates, and finally note any items that need confirmation before the plan is finalised.
#### June
The tasks for June include:
- Moving all my belongings from Amsterdam to Genoa:
  - In particular, resolving the issue with the bike.
- Visiting Makki in Bonn.
- Spending one or two weeks in Genoa.
- Generally working on the [[Master Thesis]].

In the upcoming weeks, and certainly well before June, I must finalise a plan for transferring all my belongings to Genoa—a process that should take no more than one or two days. Once this is arranged, I can travel to visit Makki in Bonn, taking only a few essentials and the bike (unless it has already been shipped to Genoa), and leave the bike with Makki. I would then fly from Bonn to Genoa (or Milan) and remain there until the end of June. To finalise the dates, I first need confirmation from Makki, but independently, I believe it would be beneficial to spend the initial ten days in Amsterdam to maintain focus on my thesis. Following this, I could spend approximately five days with Makki in Bonn and then relocate to Genoa around the 15th June. I would reside in Genoa for the remaining two weeks of the month before booking tickets to Australia and China.

To be confirmed are:
- How to move my belongings from Amsterdam to Genoa.
- Arrangements for the bike.
- Precise dates for the visit to Makki.
#### July
Almost all of July will be spent in Australia, following the plans outlined in [[Beijing and Sydney]]. Here, I will purchase the [[Buying MacBook Air 15 inch]] and work on the [[Master Thesis]]. By the end of the month, before the 24th, I will be on a flight from Sydney to Beijing to spend the remaining two weeks there.

To be confirmed are:
- Dates for the hotel in China, as arranged by the university.
- Final resit dates for the last three courses.
#### August
I will begin August already in Beijing. By then, I hope to have news updates beyond what I have as of \[10.04.2025\], and I will know better where to go next (see [[Some Occupational Prospects for 2025-2026]]). I will probably have already purchased my ticket from Beijing to another city. I will consider, as mentioned in [[Summer 2025#On when to buy the tickets]], whether it is more sensible to buy all tickets together or wait.
