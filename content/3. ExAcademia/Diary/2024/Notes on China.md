I paste here some preliminary research done with ChatGPT 4.5 Deep Research. The first one concerns research centers in Logic in China, while the second one is about living costs in the major Chinese cities.
### Major Research Centers in Mathematical Logic and Mathematical Philosophy in China

Below is a list of key institutions—both university-based and independent research institutes—dedicated to research in mathematical logic and mathematical philosophy in China. The list includes the official websites (or relevant links) for each centre where available.

#### University-Based Research Centers

- **Peking University – Center for Logic, Language, and Cognition (CLLC)**  
  A centre within PKU’s Department of Philosophy that conducts research in mathematical and philosophical logic, addressing topics from modal logic to the foundations of mathematics.  
  [Visit the CLLC Website](https://logic.pku.edu.cn)
	- see [Bokai Yao](https://en.phil.pku.edu.cn/people/faculty/logic/532893.htm), potentially related to [[Applications and Limitations of Interpretations in Ontology]]

- **Tsinghua University – University of Amsterdam Joint Research Centre for Logic**  
  A collaborative research centre established by Tsinghua University and the University of Amsterdam that promotes research in mathematical logic, logic in philosophy, and their applications in computer science and linguistics.

- **Sun Yat-sen University – Institute of Logic and Cognition (ILC)**  
  A prominent institute at SYSU dedicated to interdisciplinary research in logic and cognition, covering both pure mathematical logic and its applications in areas such as artificial intelligence and cognitive science.  
  [Visit the ILC Website](https://logic.sysu.edu.cn/en)

#### Independent Research Institutes

- **Chinese Academy of Sciences – Institute of Philosophy (Beijing)**  
  The CAS Institute of Philosophy includes a dedicated centre for logic and mathematical philosophy. It addresses foundational questions at the intersection of formal logic, the philosophy of mathematics, and philosophy of science.
