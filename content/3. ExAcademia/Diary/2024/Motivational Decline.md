I have previously asked myself the question whether [[Is it the Begin of a Motivational Decline]], particularly in relation to the desire to diversify the various pursuits in my life (see [[Self-esteem Diversification]]). Currently, my predominant concern is the uncertainty surrounding the pursuit of an academic career.

While a successful academic career may eventually afford a more measured pace, the present process appears excessively intense. For instance, although undertaking a PhD is inherently challenging, it may offer a more relaxed timeline than the rapid pace I am currently imposing upon myself.

After dedicating several years—three full years—to an intense and singular focus, I have experienced a reduction in motivation. This situation is analogous to extreme thirst: initially, one is eager to drink several glasses of water; however, after the first two, the desire for a third glass diminishes markedly.

Building on this metaphor, it becomes evident that my overwhelming passion for studying logic has, at this point, reached a minimum. I believe that allowing myself a period of respite, either as a break or in combination with a diversification of activities, may be beneficial. Engaging in alternative pursuits—such as establishing a Latin-speaking club or other endeavours that spark my enthusiasm—could provide a welcome distraction, ultimately helping to rekindle my passion for logic, mathematics, philosophy, and related disciplines. Additionally, allocating some space for entrepreneurial activities or similar interests might further contribute to a more balanced and fulfilling approach.

At the present moment, I do not find it sensible to make any immediate, active decisions. Firstly, I must await the responses to my PhD applications, anticipated by mid-March. Following this, I will re-evaluate my options based on the outcomes. Rather than committing to a prolonged sabbatical, it seems more pragmatic to maintain my current schedule, possibly incorporating a brief vacation of one or two months before commencing the PhD, or alternatively, to initiate a parallel engagement in other activities alongside my studies.

In conclusion, it is advisable to diversify my interests and to seriously consider taking a break during which I refrain from contemplating logic for at least one to two months. This break could ideally be scheduled immediately after the submission of my master's thesis, yet prior to the commencement of the PhD.

This is a written version of a vocal note I made on ChatGPT, not particularly satisfying.
