I have never suffered from low self-esteem, yet I have clearly noticed significant differences in how I perceive myself at different stages of my life. From feeling great when receiving good marks or coming up with original ideas to experiencing lower moments, such as receiving negative feedback on most of my philosophical essays (see [[What I don't Enjoy in Philosophical Writing]]). 

For this reason, I believe that having some form of diversification is crucial to maintaining stability during such fluctuations. In other words, I need to engage in different activities that I enjoy and find valuable beyond just my academic career. A second motivation for this conclusion is the highly competitive nature of academia. Although I have always been certain about pursuing an academic career, I cannot be sure that it will always remain my goal, nor that I won’t grow tired of it one day. In fact, I have other interests, particularly in the more adventurous and self-driven nature of entrepreneurship, as reflected in the projects I describe in [[Financial Ideas]].

In the past, a similar role of diversification has also been played by relationships, which have helped balance these ups and downs (see [[28.03.24, Nardin#Amorose]]). However, given the unpredictability of that aspect, I do not discuss it here.

What I think makes sense, though, is to gradually place less weight on academic life and increasingly prioritise—not necessarily the romantic aspect, but at least the social and professional aspects. Regarding my professional life, I do not see it as necessarily separate from academia, since I intend to remain in research throughout my life. However, working as an entrepreneur and pursuing some of the ideas in [[Financial Ideas]] might help mitigate these fluctuations. 

Additionally, I expect these fluctuations to become less frequent as I transition from being a student to becoming a researcher and advancing in my career. In particular, I believe that few things will cause as significant swings as the outcome of [[PhD Applications Results]].
