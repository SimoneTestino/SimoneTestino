I write conclusions and developments of this note in [[House Purchase]].

The main motivation for the house purchase follows from the present situation where there appears to be no available PhD position for me for the upcoming academic year (see [[Motivational Decline]], [[Some Occupational Prospects for 2025-2026]]) and thus I am also less motivated to complete the [[Master Thesis]] and the remaining research projects ([[Forcing on Urelements (Research Project)]], [[Structuralism & Categories (Research Project)]]) within the [[6th Semester]]. Combined with what happened with the [[Amsterdam Mussic Network]] (which I detail in separately archived notes) and the fact that the remaining obligations for concluding my studies do not require me to remain in Amsterdam, I plan to find a cheaper and more socially comfortable place to stay for the upcoming semester or year. Principally for social reasons, this place is, in all probability, going to be Busalla (see [[28.03.24, Nardin]]). Apart from the negative aspects that drive me to this conclusion *instead* of one I might otherwise find preferable, there are also positive ones: the primary of these is certainly the possibility to work full time on [[Luna]].

##### Loan Conditions
The current context of positive and negative factors outlined above, together with the fact that the APR for a first house loan in Italy is as low as 2.4% (see [facile.it](https://www.facile.it/mutui/preventivo-mutuo-prima-casa.html) or ISP), may make it reasonable to consider purchasing a cheap house in which I can spend the coming year whilst letting the remaining rooms and eventually converting the property to being fully let out once I move away. I make these calculations in [[House Purchase Code]]. 

Properties I am currently considering are:

- [Minceto](https://www.immobiliare.it/annunci/119518785/) at **€18,000**, requiring no renovation
- [Croce](https://www.immobiliare.it/annunci/119234477/) at **€22,000**, requiring only furnishing
- [Pietrafraccia](https://www.immobiliare.it/annunci/112576787/) at **€24,000**, see details below

For the expenses, I must also consider the bureaucratic cost of the purchase, which I estimate to be around **€3,500**, see [link](https://www.idealista.it/mutui/guide/come-accendere-un-mutuo/spese-e-tasse). 
##### House as a Source of Income
On the other hand, I can consider the house as a source of income, namely by making it an Airbnb or letting it at fixed prices. Both types of letting can be considered in two different ways depending on the house I purchase:

- If I were to buy **Minceto** ([link](https://www.immobiliare.it/annunci/119518785/)), there would be only one bedroom and, therefore, it would be quite complicated to let only one room whilst living in another. For that house, I might decide to let it solely when I am not staying there or create a small living space from the tavern for when I have guests. The tavern already has a kitchen but appears not to have a bathroom; if this is added and regulations are checked, I could stay in the tavern when guests are present (in the case of Airbnb) or live there if I let the main apartment on a continuous basis.

- If I were to buy **Croce** ([link](https://www.immobiliare.it/annunci/119234477/)), then I would have three bedrooms within the same apartment, which would allow me to let out two of these for Airbnb and/or on a long-term basis. This has the advantage that Croce is a larger village and would therefore likely have higher demand for longer-term lettings compared to Minceto, but it would still be hampered by the fact that for long-term lets it is difficult to find people wishing to rent only a room. For Airbnb, it would probably be less profitable to have two rooms rather than the entire flat, as overlaps in tourist presence are unlikely and the profit from letting a flat can be much greater than the income from letting a room with shared facilities.

To take a quantitative approach with the Airbnb option, I make an [[Airbnb Market Analysis Code]]. Regarding long-term lets, I note that the [taxation](https://www.agenziaentrate.gov.it/portale/aree-tematiche/casa/affitto/cedolare-secca) is between 10 - 21%, with an average rent for similar properties at around **€450** per month (see [immobiliare.it](https://www.immobiliare.it/search-list/?idContratto=2&idCategoria=1&superficieMinima=60&superficieMassima=80&localiMinimo=3&bagni=1&__lang=it&vrt=44.505321%2C8.834381%3B44.575796%2C8.790436%3B44.646185%2C8.795929%3B44.73015%2C8.784943%3B44.769162%2C8.838501%3B44.768187%2C8.960724%3B44.759411%2C9.087067%3B44.71161%2C9.251862%3B44.659862%2C9.324646%3B44.564056%2C9.347992%3B44.496505%2C9.342499%3B44.448487%2C9.316406%3B44.444566%2C9.163971%3B44.443585%2C9.070587%3B44.447507%2C8.973083%3B44.472011%2C8.898926%3B44.505321%2C8.834381&pag=1&mapCenter=44.590223%2C9.025269&zoom=11#geohash-spyme9d2)).

##### Mortgage and Financing Considerations
Another major issue to resolve is securing credit from a bank, since utilising my own savings to cover the cost of the house would prove unproductive in the long run, as shares yield far more than any property under consideration ever could. Arranging a loan for a house requires reaching €37,500 so that the 80% bank loan amounts to at least €30,000, which is the minimum for a first house mortgage. Not reaching that figure would result in excessively high interest rates, bringing the situation close to that in which I pay in cash. To reach total expenses of €37,500, a major fraction of the house’s costs would go towards renovation, which remains subject to a 50% bonus as an IRPEF deduction over 10 years—a benefit I may never be able to make full use of, since I can hardly imagine myself paying significant IRPEF for much of that period. Alternatively, I can undertake renovations qualifying as "_rimozione delle barriere architettoniche_" (see [agenziadelleentrate.it](https://www.agenziaentrate.gov.it/portale/eliminazione-delle-barriere-architettoniche), [biblus](https://biblus.acca.it/bonus-barriere-architettoniche/#toggle-id-11-closed), [link](https://www.bosettiegatti.eu/info/norme/statali/1989_0236.htm)), i.e. primarily building stairways suitable for people with mild or severe disabilities and, by doing so, I would recover 75% of the expenses as an instant discount, allowing me to retain a significant part of the liquidity from the bank loan, which can then be reinvested. A particularly suitable flat for this is the one in [Pietrafraccia](https://www.immobiliare.it/annunci/112576787/).

Since it is a detached house with two flats that need to be connected by converting the currently external stairs into indoor stairs so that it qualifies as a single flat. It may also be worthwhile to consider incentives for solar panels, see [link](https://biblus.acca.it/bonus-fotovoltaico-tutte-le-possibili-agevolazioni/).

A major advantage of the house in Pietrafraccia is that it is independent and allows for several improvements over the years that I would not have the freedom to do on any other house I saw. The potential of the two canteen / taverns of 30m$^2$ each, of the division or union of the two apartments and of the external garden and space is definitely going to be have a lot of potential in case, in a future, I decide to invest more in it and make a nice vacation house out of it. On top of that, it has been mentioned by the agency selling it, i.e. Federica Sinisi, that there currently is a problem with the fact that the two apartments are recognised as two separate ones as they are not internally connected but only by external stairs, there was the plan to make those stairs internal but this resulted in not being allowed by the Comune. When hearing that there was a problem with stairs I immediately thought about the bonus at 75% for "_rimozione delle barriere architettoniche_" which still allows for stairs and might apply in this case. There are in fact currently external ramps of stair, then also 3 - 4 stairs that are in the major bathroom and finally there may be somes when going to the taverns. Each of this stairs has a potential for the bonus and shall all be considered for it. In this case one should read the part relative to today in the [[Again on Margin Investing]] as I am not considering anymore to gain levarage through a Prima Casa mortgage but instead as a personal loan at low interests as I am a student. I shall consider therefore the bonus just as a discount of 75% on all approved operations instead of something more elaborate to get margin. It could do be used to get margin if I was to pay for these restructuring through a mortgage with ISP for which could enjoy lower rates if it was to also take care about the windows as they would greatly increase the energetic efficiency of the house as the current ones are very old and definitely do not close well. Using the (un)necessary restructuring of the stairs and windows to lower the reseller price, which I assume to have been kept stable since it has been posted 11 months ago.

After hearing from the agency it seems that all ideas I had have been confirmed, the taverns are going to require substantial renovation (though not structural, so I may be able to handle all of it alone) and the rest of the apartment is going to be fine. I found out that the IMU tax does not apply for the first home and that the operations that has been attempted in the past was to close the external stairs with a brick walls, which would have extended the planimetry of the house. 

An advantage for the house in Pietrafraccia that follows is the fact that, by being independent, it may allow for more business segments than only the Airbnb. In fact I may open it to organise events like birthdays and similar events by offering a nice open air area and by renovating the ...
