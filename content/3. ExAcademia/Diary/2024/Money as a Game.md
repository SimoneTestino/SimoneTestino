In this essay, I explore my current attitude towards money and the way I handle it. Presently, the amount of money in my bank account—whether minimal or significantly higher—does not substantially alter the core values that guide my life. My primary focus remains on achievements and experiences that are independent of financial status.

I do, however, recognise that future circumstances might require a shift in these priorities. For instance, the need to achieve financial stability could become more pronounced when striving for independence or supporting a family. Despite this potential shift, my present approach treats money as if it were a game—a challenge to be optimised rather than an end in itself.

This game-like perspective on money involves carefully strategising long-term financial goals, much like maximising a score. Whether it is through optimising various methods to accumulate wealth or engaging in friendly competitions to reach a financial milestone, I find the complexity and myriad variables involved both intellectually stimulating and entertaining.

In conclusion, my current approach to money is characterised by a playful, game-like attitude. While I remain dedicated to managing my finances effectively, I prioritise non-monetary values and achievements, acknowledging that these priorities may evolve as my personal circumstances change.
