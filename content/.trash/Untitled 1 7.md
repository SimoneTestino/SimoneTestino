 Dear Juliette,

  

As previously mentioned, here you can find the calendar with the people who stayed paying from the start of the contract, please note the overlapping. As it was more comfortable to have a private room most of the time, and also being aware of the risks you reported, I had all visitors in two distinct periods:

Fist period of 3 days: from the 28th September until the 30th 
3 people slept at my place.

Second period of 5 days: from the 14th October until the 18th October
The five people who came during those days were not in a group and therefore came in and out in different moments.  

Other than to those people, of the 15 different uses you mentioned of the function keyfriends, there have been no other paying visitors.

Regarding the adds on TripBFF, they were already deleted weeks ago and the website has not been updated in a while (and has now been deleted from the homepage). In fact, I already took the warning that arrived on the application by Lieven de Key some days ago as a sign that the risk was too high.  

I find it appropriate to finally remark that I decided to sublet the room in that period as result of a difficult financial situation which is hardly compatible with the living costs of Amsterdam, if not by renouncing to some comforts like a private room and taking such risks.

An analogous motive is behind my current attempt to finish the Master of Logic at the UvA in half the time (i.e. within the year in which this room has been guaranteed). On top of that, I also work online for a tutoring company which clearly does not suffice to make the cashflow positive.

Best regards,

Simone
