Dear Sebastian,

To begin, I wanted to ask if there is an appointment scheduled for the viewing of the class exam.

Secondly, I would like to ask for some clarifications, and potentially some adjustments, regarding the grading methods for the presentation. If I understand the grading process correctly, it appears to involve a considerable element of randomness. Below, I outline both why I believe this to be the case and why it was particularly unfortunate in my situation. I also propose a solutions, which might serve as suggestions for future classes.

Firstly, the presentation grade depends on the performance of the entire group. However, unlike other cases, we were not simply allowed to choose classmates with whom we wanted to collaborate. Instead, we were expected to select a topic, which effectively determined our group members. This procedure creates a dilemma: one could either choose to work with specific people (assuming one knows who the "best" students in the class are) or pick a preferred topic. Despite the latter option being recommended, it introduces a significant element of randomness in the final grade. To my knowledge, this approach is unique to this course among those offered in the Master of Logic programme, i.e. other courses either do not even evaluate presentations or the mark is individual or the choice of the group does not influence the material on which the group will work. These may be taken as suggestions for future classes.

I would now like to explain why my situation was particularly unlucky, and hence unfair, given that grades should not hinge so heavily on chance. I want to stress that my objective here is solely to seek clarity on grading, rather than to disparage anyone. My engagement and appreciation for the course were evident in those grades that significantly depended on them, as reflected in my final average of 9.2 (excluding the presentation), resulted from getting the best mark in all assignments and in the final exam. On the other hand, on the day of the presentation, it was apparent that the other team members had not read the paper we were scheduled to present.

Despite the disparity in effort, I did my best to maximise the outcome of the presentation: I organised the meeting according to the most convenient time and place for the others, wrote the large majority of the slides, presented for well over half of the total time, and addressed all questions that arose. Additionally, I answered Eline’s questions after the presentation satisfactorily (she may provide a more specific assessment on this point). Yet, this increased effort did not translate into a barely satisfactorily grade, which would have been more attainable under luckier circumstances.

Consequently, my presentation grade was 6.9 (excluding a +0.5 for class participation), which brought my overall average down. Not only did this prevent me from reaching the threshold of 9.25, which would have raised my grade to 9.5 once rounded, but it also dropped my score slightly below 8.75, resulting in a final grade rounded down to 8.5. While fairness in the grading of the presentation is certainly a relevant concern, especially for future cohorts, my only priority is ensuring that my final grade for the course does not fall below 9.0. This result is achieved, if my computations are correct, by setting the grade of the presentation to 7.21 (resulting in 7.71 counting the +0.5 for class participation), this would still be well 1.2 marks below the class average, still resulting in an enormous discontinuity in my grades compared to the rest of the class.

If this conclusion does not appear justified based on the details provided, please let me know what else I could have done to achieve a more accurate assessment of my work on the presentation.

Eline suggested that I should have raised the issue earlier if there were problems with the preparation. However, I believe this approach is both unfair to the group members (if someone wishes to invest less effort in the project, why should they be compelled to work to my standard to achieve a 9 they might not necessarily aim for?) and impractical. Until shortly before the presentation, there was still hope that the others would contribute more actively (e.g., by preparing their own slides and familiarising themselves with their sections of the paper). Given these circumstances, how would it have been feasible to provide any meaningful intervention by your or her side?

Please let me know if you would prefer to discuss this matter in person—perhaps during the viewing of the exam. I am certainly available.

Thank you and best regards,  
Simone
