I wasn’t extremely impressed when it first came out, but I found it useful for various tasks, such as rewriting or improving the clarity of my notes—this note itself is an example, as are many others I’ve written for this website. Even now, I’m not fully satisfied with its ability to properly reformulate texts that contain more general or imprecise content, like my recent note on [[Motivational Decline]].  

What does impress me, though, is its ability to generate proofs. In particular, I’ve used it for [Overleaf: Exercises on Modal Logic](https://www.overleaf.com/read/xkskcjnbhcjk#e9e8fa) (also see [[Introduction to Modal Logic (Lecture)]]), and it’s remarkable how well it performs—producing proofs in a niche field with perfect clarity and, as far as I can tell, complete correctness.
