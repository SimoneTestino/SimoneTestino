1.  Am I allowed to organise a research project that involves other students too?
    - Is it possible to make it so that, every research project of each student is independent so that the amount of credits and work done by each student can vary significantly?
2. How is the amount of credits for the project determined? Is just the supervisor the one deciding how much it will be valued?
