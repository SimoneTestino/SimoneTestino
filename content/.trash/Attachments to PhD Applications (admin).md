On this page I attach most documents I will need to submit for my [[PhD Applications in the US]]. I divide those document between those I need to write myself, like motivational / personal statements and the (un)official documents produced from universities, like the transcript of records. I will first write the application for [[PhD Applications in the US#Princeton]] because of the preceding deadline and I will therefore take these as the main documents I will then need to edit for the other application I will submit before new-year.
### Attachments for [[PhD Applications in the US#Princeton]]
To begin I will produce a document that directly refers to this page, so that any potential mistake in my application or incomprehension can most probably be solved by reading what follows. This will be attached in the additional documents and is linked here: [Overleaf: Princeton: Index of Attachments](https://www.overleaf.com/read/kskbjmxtcxfh#7f9e8e).

The most important files for the application are:
- [Overleaf: Princeton: Academic Statement of Purpose](https://www.overleaf.com/read/kyvshfzxxhmk#9448fc)
- [Overleaf: Princeton: Personal Statement](https://www.overleaf.com/read/sszvfsspnjfd#2193b5)
- [Overleaf: Princeton: Writing Sample]()

Other documents I need to provide are some commenting the documents from the [[Documents#University of Constance (Documents)]]. In particular regarding the [[B.Sc. Mathematics (LMU)]] and the complex way of computing the average (also see: [Spreadsheet: Marks LMU](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NNubLg1C2IOX1Rs3ishnJDjQ0yhacul_Y8lLVrWSW6c/edit?usp=sharing)). This documents can be found here:
- [Overleaf: Comment on ToR BSc](https://www.overleaf.com/read/kytmwxbnqcrn#881948)

I will do similarly for the [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]] in particular underlying the final courses I am aiming to get and giving an updated version of the marks I will receive by the end of December (also uploaded here [Spreadsheet: MoL Marks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OjD1LdGdszllAu5bL-Eybfb4XEd2fofWphFoyJliLjw/edit?usp=sharing)).
- [Overleaf: Comment on ToR MSc](https://www.overleaf.com/read/rcrkcxvspbkv#5337da)

Of least importance, since often it is asked to give the employment history, I write an additional document in which I say a couple of words more on my work at [[Futura]].
- [Overleaf: Employment History](https://www.overleaf.com/read/dvtnzhqqxpbs#69b6de)

Here I also list the official documents I submitted:
- [[B.A. Philosophy Diploma (English).pdf]]
- [Overleaf: Comment on ToR BSc](https://www.overleaf.com/read/kytmwxbnqcrn#881948) & [[Transcript_of_Records_HF_Mathe_03.12.24.pdf]] & [[Transcript_of_Records_NF_Philo_03.12.24.pdf]]
- [Overleaf: Comment on ToR MSc](https://www.overleaf.com/read/rcrkcxvspbkv#5337da) & [[ToR_MSc_Logic_UvA_03.12.24.pdf]]

List of the PDFs I actually submit on the portal.

### English as my Primary Language
It may be useful to add a few words about my relationship with the English language, as the informal requirement that some universities have for being a native speaker may be somewhat ambiguous. This will allow the reader to determine whether I should be exempted from the requirement or not.

By August 2025, I will obtain my degree [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]], which is taught entirely in English. Over the past years, both my academic and non-academic interactions have primarily been in English. Before moving to Amsterdam, during my studies at [[LMU Munich]], most of my interactions—despite my knowledge of German—were conducted entirely in English. In fact, all essays I wrote for Philosophy courses were written in English (all available at [[Index of Bachelor Works]]).

Additionally, my current relationship is with an Australian and is conducted entirely in English. I have spoken English from a very young age, having grown up in an international environment where I used English, German, and Italian daily, as outlined in my [[Condensed Biography]].

To meet the formal requirement for admission to the [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]], I also obtained the [[CAE English Certificate (C1).pdf]] with grades significantly exceeding the minimum required. Academically, I am far more fluent and accustomed to writing in English than in any other language. In non-academic contexts, however, I feel equally confident speaking English, Italian, or German.
