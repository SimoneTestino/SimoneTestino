On this page, I provide references to all my academic writings since the beginning of my academic journey. This differs from [[Notes & Papers]], where I compile more passive notes and remarks on others' work. For a broader overview, I include an index of each course I have taken, along with the corresponding notes, essays, and related active work produced for both my bachelor's and master's programmes.

- [[Index of Bachelor Works]]  
- [[Index of Master Works]]  

For a more research-oriented perspective, I offer an alternative indexing method in [[Research Areas]]. There, I list the fields in which I am proficient and, beyond cataloguing the courses I have taken, I also provide details on the work I have conducted in each area.

As part of my academic life, I also maintain an [[Academic Diary]], where I reflect on a variety of life choices that influence the direction of my academic career.
