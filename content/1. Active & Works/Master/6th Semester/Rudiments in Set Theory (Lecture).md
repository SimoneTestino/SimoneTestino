I will follow this course at the ILLC for my [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]] during my [[6th Semester]], here is the [Catalogue Link](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2024-2025-en/search-course/course/119766). I write on this page only notes or discussions that I find novel given my past background in [[Set Theory]]. The exercises I submitted can be found at [Overleaf: Set Theory Exercises](https://www.overleaf.com/read/jgrbbnpvwsms#c8c94e).
