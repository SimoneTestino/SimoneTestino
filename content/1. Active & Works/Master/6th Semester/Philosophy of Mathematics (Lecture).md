I will follow this course by Dr. Luca Incurvati at the ILLC for my [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]] during my [[6th Semester]], here is the [Catalogue Link](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2024-2025-en/search-course/course/114778). I worked on the assignments and referee report in [Overleaf: PhiMath Reports](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hjkcjdcwbrww#6ecb41) and I read [[Tait, W. W. (1981). Finitism]] and presented the last third of it in class in [Overleaf: PhiMath Presentation](https://www.overleaf.com/4348514188cmtywrzqvgng#cc0fa8). As final essay, I worked then on [[Applications and Limitations of Interpretations in Ontology]]
