I will write my Master Thesis starting in January 2025 and will discuss it by the end of August.

### Finding a Topic
The sources I am currently consulting in order to pick the particular research question I want to work on are [Higher Order Logic and Disquotational Truth](https://philpapers.org/rec/PICHLA) and [Deflationism and the Function of Truth](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333212194_Deflationism_And_The_Function_Of_Truth). The general intention is to take the Translation Theory developed by Prof. van Bentham and connect it with truth theory and the research topics of Dr. Schindler. I am also considering, as suggested by Dr. Picenni, to look for applications of Translation Theory in finding a relative definition of Hyperintentional Logics.
### Literature
I begin in January by reading from the list given at the [presentation](https://projects.illc.uva.nl/lgc/seminar/2024/10/lira-session-johan-van-benthem-5/): [[2024-11-21-LIRa--Johan_van_Benthem_Translation.pdf]]. I then proceed with the two papers suggested above.
