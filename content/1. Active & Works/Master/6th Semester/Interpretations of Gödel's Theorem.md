Definition of $\omega$-consistency, there is a class sign r such that there is no proposition ($x$ Gen $r$ ) that neither $x$ Gen $r$ nor $\lnot (x$ Gen $r)$ belongs to the class of consequences. And here Gen is the generalisation, i.e. the universal quantifier. Idk try what that means but okay.

For any consistent formal system, there is a sentence which can neither be proved or disproved.
