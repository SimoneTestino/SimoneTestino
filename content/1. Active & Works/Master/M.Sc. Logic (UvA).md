Here I discuss my achievement of the [Master of Logic](https://msclogic.illc.uva.nl/) (120 EC) at the University of Amsterdam, specifically at the [ILLC](https://www.illc.uva.nl/), which I complete during my [[5th Semester]] and [[6th Semester]] of university. All the work I did during my master's programme can be found in the [[Index of Master Works]], including the [[Master Thesis]]. I also track my academic progress and marks in the [Spreadsheet: MoL Marks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OjD1LdGdszllAu5bL-Eybfb4XEd2fofWphFoyJliLjw/edit?usp=sharing). A more detailed discussion of the general trajectory of my master's studies is available in the [[Master's Outline]].
