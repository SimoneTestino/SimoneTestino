I list here all lecture notes and active works I produced during my [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]] ordering them by topics. For those notes / essays I wrote for courses I also write how many EC they counted and the semester & period  in which I took them. Finally, here is the link to my [[Master Thesis]], I make general considerations on my Masters in [[Master's Outline]],
