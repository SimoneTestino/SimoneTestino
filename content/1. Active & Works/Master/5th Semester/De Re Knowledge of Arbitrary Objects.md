If I will be particularly satisfied with the outcome of the paper I will consider submitting it to the [Dynamic Logic Conference](https://www.illc.uva.nl/NewsandEvents/Events/Conferences/newsitem/15152/Special-Issue-of-the-Journal-of-Logic-Language-and-Information-on-Dynamic-Logic---New-Trends-and-Applications-) (or [ECSQARU 2025](https://ecsqaru2025.krportal.org/), [unict](https://www.dmi.unict.it/fois2025/?page_id=306)) by the 31st January 2025. If I will decide to do so, I will need to update my [[PhD Applications in the US]]  & [[PhD Applications in the EU & UK]].
