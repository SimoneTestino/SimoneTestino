For the course in [[Philosophy of Cognition (Lecture)]] by Dr. Sbardolini that I followed during my [[5th Semester]] for my [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]], I wrote this essay: [Overleaf: Ontic Structuralism of Concepts](https://www.overleaf.com/read/rydctsstmgsh#fa9a27). It has a very tightly connected with [[Structuralism & Categories (Research Project)]]. I also consider submitting the paper to [FOIS](https://www.dmi.unict.it/fois2025/?page_id=306). \[29.06.2025\], I didn't anymore after the [[Ontic Structuralism Feedback]].

The proof of the only non trivial proposition, Completeness Results 1.3, can be found at [StackExchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3470132/about-infinite-discrete-linear-orders-theory).
