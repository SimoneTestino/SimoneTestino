I followed this course by Dr. Giorgio Sbardolini for my [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]] during my [[5th Semester]]. The work I am doing for the [[Structuralism & Categories (Research Project)]] influenced me greatly in the approach I had to the material of the course, in particular after realising that there is a debate on the application of a structuralist ontology to concepts as briefly mentioned in the SEP entry on Concepts and criticised in the first questions listed in the assignment below. I collected some of the assignments in [Overleaf: PhiCogn](https://www.overleaf.com/read/jxyywsdtmycg#07db76).

I then presented a general approach one can have to apply structuralist ontology to concepts to the class: [Overleaf: PhiCogn Presentation](https://www.overleaf.com/read/fnnmcnrpmmpn#772e6f).

In order to complete the course I write this essay: [[Ontic Structuralism of Concepts]].
