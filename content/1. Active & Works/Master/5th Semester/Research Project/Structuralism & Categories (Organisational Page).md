Here I report all the tasks I did and pages I published on this website to fully organise this first project. Since the organisational side of it, other than the content, has been certainly challenging, I imagine this page may be interesting to some.
## The First Prospect
### Previous Work in the Field
Before getting into the proper skills and interest in the topic, I present my general background and my approach to the field and to general academic practice. I have studied both [[B.A. Philosophy (LMU)]] and in [[B.Sc. Mathematics (LMU)]] (30 ECTS remaining before completion) in 2 years (see [[Bachelors' Outline]]), the first one at the University of Constance and the second at the LMU Munich. Now I am a first year student of the [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]] and, by keeping the same pace, I am considering to finish it within one year or to spend the second on own research (see [[5th Semester]]). The only relevant message that should come out of this, is that I intend to work substantially for this research project and let it count for the corresponding amount of credits, this though, I suppose, could not prevent [[Structuralism & Categories (Research Project)#Teamwork]].

To the more substantial information: for my [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]] I am taking both [[Philosophy of Science (Lecture)]] and [[Category Theory (Lecture)]], by the time of the begin of the research project the former course will be finished, though not the latter, which will just have reached half of the material; I will discuss with the lecturer which other sources shall be consulted in order to have the sufficient technical competence. During my [[B.A. Philosophy (LMU)]], I took a couple of other relevant courses for which I wrote essays that will give the basis to the [[Structuralism & Categories (Research Project)#Project Structure & Goals]]. In particular I followed a course "Category Theory for the Working Philosopher" a course which, after giving the necessary technical skills, delved into the applications of category theory within philosophy; for this course I wrote [[Structure on Models]], an essay which answered critically to [[Halvorson, H. (2012), What Scientific Theories Could not Be]]. I happened to write essays concerning structuralism also for a course in Philosophy of Logic, [[Correspondence]] and [[The Silent Assumption in Tarskian Semantics]]. Finally, I spent some time writing a critical comment to [[Horsten, L. (2010), Having an Interpretation]], by my former professor [[Leon Horsten]].
#### First Organisation Steps towards Realisation
1. Ask Dr. Sebastian de Haro Ollé and Prof. Benno van den Berg for approval
	1. Is it doable with satisfactory depth and completeness in 6 weeks? (I am counting Christmas vacation, in which I will begin reading the literature and determine potential research tracks for other students to collaborate)
	2. Do you have any literature to suggest? (Perhaps other related topics, or further papers in the same field. It would also help to have, particularly on the categorical side, some introduction to the technical skills required)
	3. Do you have any member of ILLC or other researcher to suggest? (Could be both for co-supervision or just for a one-time discussion on the topic with me and potentially other students involved)
	4. Does the field I described well fit your research interests? (Connected to the question above, if the field were not within your field of research, do you have somebody else to suggest, within or outside of the ILLC?)
	5. How many EC would you estimate? (Considering the remarks made above on the amount of pages the work will consist of, hours I plan to invest in and papers I plan to read before)
		6. How does participation of other students influence it? (considering that it would imply a proportionally larger amount of work, not delegation of present work but development of new ideas and branches of research)
2. Team Coordination
	1. Begin to read some literature, whatever is vaguely needed to make the sketch of a plan.
	2. Share this page to the group-chats of Category Theory and Philosophy of Science and search students willing to join the project.
		1. Make a [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdx_ATY579NgdwSeGapf1_-P9XYiqg6BDwgNxsD1U4_V4FzEA/viewform?usp=sf_link) with interests, competence area and background and select in case too many people wanted to participate.
	3. Schedule from two to five discussion-meetings with the other students on those papers that will be relevant for the project, in order of priority:
		1. [[Halvorson, H. (2012), What Scientific Theories Could not Be]]
		2. [Criteria of Identity and Structural Ontology](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hannes-Leitgeb-2/publication/31349684_Criteria_of_Identity_and_Structuralist_Ontology/links/00463534fdb154f8b7000000/Criteria-of-Identity-and-Structuralist-Ontology.pdf?origin=publicationDetail&_sg%5B0%5D=ulrFKJxSo5jaNeCcC_G-SfIm5cfSOghXDvamINp01-TwUpbBUL2LZjzXUmEE_TSkJL4KY8RIQLMb78iVP7Yv9g.d4mRcbQrbo2MXHb7VkwdtNFfg3MZgisp3B7yGzzuAeAobShv-_XM3l4jFIBw5uU7fLgm5lNQGoWR08qbtX3w3g&_sg%5B1%5D=h_I-RdO0AXbmNUQr62JiRf-9ii05sny7fCG1xftvDZBrgPNtrjcbRebTln1M1wXcSNT3eNjdXzOCy3RgIQZTt-cSGX6SxWoaeZzrtxlZotb0.d4mRcbQrbo2MXHb7VkwdtNFfg3MZgisp3B7yGzzuAeAobShv-_XM3l4jFIBw5uU7fLgm5lNQGoWR08qbtX3w3g&_iepl=&_rtd=eyJjb250ZW50SW50ZW50IjoibWFpbkl0ZW0ifQ%3D%3D&_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIiwicGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIiwicG9zaXRpb24iOiJwYWdlSGVhZGVyIn19) (?)
		3. One text selected by [[Bas van Fraassen]]
		4. Eventually, for discussion: (agree or disagree with my strong position)
			1. [[Structure on Models]]
			2. [[Horsten, L. (2010), Having an Interpretation]]
	4. Have a final discussion so that, by the end of it, only those students that have their own topic of research are selected and combine a complete plan of the whole research project.
		1. Each student shall have their own plan and schedule
			- This will be submitted before the begin of the Christmas Vacation to the supervisors so that they can estimate the EC that will be assigned to each one of the students.
		2. We organise some check-points during the 3rd period so that we can discuss the present state of the work.
#### Questions & People to Reach Out
In particular here are a list of the main questions that should be answered before getting started with the project:
- Is there someone in particular within or outside the ILLC, who you think could give us some particular insights that could be useful for the project?
- Considering [[Structuralism & Categories (Research Project)#Hours of Work, Credits and Expected Length]], how many credits would you estimate for the project? Does it get decided before or after the project is done? 
- Is it possible to make it so that, every research project of each student is independent so that the amount of credits and work done by each student can vary significantly?
- Is it possible to receive a mark for the project instead of just to pass the module?
##### To Prof. van den Berg
- Are you interested in supervising the project? To answer, you may consider:
	- The presentation of the project as in [[Structuralism & Categories (Research Project)#Project Structure & Goals]] 
	- Despite the high EC of the project ([[Structuralism & Categories (Research Project)#Hours of Work, Credits and Expected Length]]), we expect to work autonomously and supervision will be also shared with Dr. Enrico Cinti.
- If not, is there some other member of the faculty in your field you would suggest?

If the thing gets big enough, I may want to have some roles so that everyone knows what their job is, in particular I need:
- **Responsible of Math Supervision**: check that all proofs, theorems and lemmas are sound
- **Responsible of Physics Supervision**: check facts are true
- **Responsible of Overall Coherence**: that everything fits
- **Responsible of Grounding**: check that every notion is defined & well explained either in the [[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Claim Tracks]] itself or in some of the [[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Background Tracks]].
- **Writer** of a single Track
- **Cowriter** of a single Track, needs to check that it makes sense, not necessary for all.

The project credits will likely reflect the roles each participant takes.
#### How to Handle People Once I have them
##### **Overseer's Roles**
These roles are primarily focused on technical accuracy and correctness:

- **Head of Math Oversight**: Ensures that all mathematical proofs, theorems, and lemmas are logically sound and accurate.
- **Head of Physics Oversight**: Verifies that all physical facts and calculations are scientifically accurate and consistent with established principles.

In contrast, the following roles ensure coherence and clarity across the work:

- **Head of Overall Coherence**: Ensures that all sections of the project fit together logically and consistently without contradictions.
- **Head of Conceptual Grounding**: Verifies that all notions are properly defined and thoroughly explained, either within the main content or referenced from background material.

##### **Active Roles**
These positions focus on content creation and development:

- **Writer of a Single Track**: Responsible for creating the primary content of a specific track.
- **Cowriter of a Single Track**: Assists in ensuring clarity and coherence in a particular track.

## Attempt to Build Up the Team
The [[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)]] on 16.10 was the following
This is a subpage of the [[Structuralism & Categories (Research Project)]].
### Team's Page: 16.10
Given the diversity [[Structuralism & Categories (Research Project)#Project Structure & Goals]] I think that there are three main fields we would need all student-force needed to best accomplish the end of the project:
- _Philosophers_: in particular experts in Philosophy of Science, but also generally in epistemology, metaphysics & ontology and also logic & foundations of mathematics.
- _Mathematicians_: mainly students who have expertise in Category Theory and related fields. 
- _Physicists_: anyone with a solid background in mathematical physics (I know so little that I do not even know which fields in particular are relevant, so we desperately need physicists!)

Important details on [[Structuralism & Categories (Supervisor's Page)#Bureaucracy]] are available on the [[Structuralism & Categories (Supervisor's Page)]], e.g. how many ECs one can get, deadline ecc.
#### The Team
Other than me (I present myself already in [[Structuralism & Categories (Research Project)#Personal Resources of the Project]]), I will list here the other teammates. There currently are a few candidates, I will take the choice of the team more seriously once the supervision is guaranteed (see [[Structuralism & Categories (Supervisor's Page)]].
#### Overall Structure of the Work
We will mainly work during the third block, as a research project at the UvA should be meant to be (at least for the Master of Logic, if that were not the case for MSc. Physics, we will find some solutions). Though, I plan to organise some meetings, perhaps at the beginning of the second period, when things will be decently calm again, to have all the basics in the field and plan the project together. This will probably consist of 3 - 5 times in which we meet at the Science Park to discuss papers we read before (just like a reading group). We will establish the papers together with the supervisors, but with all probability there will be: [[Halvorson, H. (2012), What Scientific Theories Could not Be]].

Each one of the student, according to the plans we will make while moving on, should be able to decide the amount of work they're willing to put into the project and get the respective credits. All of this will be asked to the supervisors (see [[Structuralism & Categories (Supervisor's Page)#Organisational Q&A]]).
#### Project's Tracks
In the broader project, there will be some smaller tracks designed by team members, based on the claims we’ve developed during our discussions and paper readings. I divide these tracks into two distinct types. The first are background tracks, which provide foundational concepts on a particular topic without introducing anything new to the existing literature ([[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Background Tracks]]). The second are tracks that present a specific claim on topics previously introduced ([[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Claim Tracks]]). It is crucial to maintain harmony between these two types, ensuring that any thesis we put forward is properly supported by prior introduction of the relevant concepts.
##### Background Tracks
- **Category Theory**: starting from what can be found in a standard book in Category Theory (like [[Category Theory (Lecture)]]), we present all required definition to get to the notion of Morita Equivalence. The approach to this introduction can be purely mathematical, i.e. written as a commented serie of definitions and results.
- **Structuralism: Semantic & Syntactic View**: with a more philosophical taste, we should presente the underlying assumptions of structuralism referring to the main papers on the topic.
	- Part of this will be taken and re-elaborated from the essays uploaded in [[Structuralism]].
##### Claim Tracks
These tracks will be the actual essence of the project and the aim of each one of the members of the team is to bring original contributions to their own or some others of the tracks listed here. Each one of the team's members are therefore welcomed to suggest tracks by writing them [here](https://www.overleaf.com/9972377763krshjstwzmwx#d9e0ff).
- S. Testino: _By presenting alternative identity criteria on semantic theories, I aim to dismantle Halvorson's argument_ ([[Halvorson, H. (2012), What Scientific Theories Could not Be]])_, which I accuse of failing to consider the actual multiplicity of possible identities._ (more on [[Structure on Models]])
- S. Testino: _Different syntactical theories are often different in different languages having a common set-theoretic (/categorical) grounding, a formal account of translations between languages is necessary._ (see [[Bachelor Thesis]])
- A. Sittoni: a ton of technical relevant in category theory can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-PKOMLwWCvZb8dQ43dpHyWLGiw2vnQJO). Andrea will not directly participate to the project, but can certainly answer questions about the claim he pointed to in his thesis, which we may develop within the project.
#### Project's Roles
The project credits will likely reflect the roles each participant takes, clearly the same person may have multiple roles, the sharing of one role may add some organisational complexity but may be taken into consideration for the more extensive roles. In the following section I present the roles, while in [[Structuralism & Categories (Tracks & Roles)]]
##### Overseer's Roles
For the most technical parts of the project, it is necessary to have someone that checks that all that have been introduced is correct. Less challenging but still crucially important, the team's members having these roles should also check that the notation among different parts of the project is consistent.
- **Head of Math Oversight**: Ensures that all mathematical proofs, theorems, and lemmas of the whole project are logically sound and accurate. They will be required also to have read _all relevant papers_ in order to ensure full comprehension of the mathematical proofs.
- **Head of Physics Oversight**: Verifies that all physical facts and calculations are scientifically accurate and consistent with established principles. They clearly also required to have covered the whole relevant literature to ensure full comprehension of the matter.

On a less technical side, but still crucial to ensure the best clarity of the project, it is necessary to have people covering these other roles:
- **Head of Overall Coherence**: Ensures that all sections of the project are coherent, that the order and general structure leads to the easiest understanding of the matter.
- **Head of Conceptual Grounding**: Verifies that all notions are properly defined and thoroughly explained, either within the main content or referenced from background material. They should also check again notational consistency, in particular of the more discorsive sections that may be overlooked by HMO and HPO. 
##### Active Roles
These roles are the most essential to the actual construction of the project. Each one of these will be in function of some of the [[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Project's Tracks]], depending on whether they are [[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Background Tracks]] or [[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Claim Tracks]].
- **Idea Developer**: They come up with an original idea presented it to the group and clearly write down a first exposition of the claim. They have then discussed it with all other team's members competent in the field and got "general approval". The idea will then be added to the [[Structuralism & Categories (Tracks & Roles)#Claim Tracks]].
- **Idea's Writer**: They write down the proper text getting to the conclusion exposed in one of the [[Structuralism & Categories (Tracks & Roles)#Claim Tracks]] and ensure that everything they begin with is already presented in one of the [[Structuralism & Categories (Tracks & Roles)#Background Tracks]], ensuring notational consistency.
- **Background Writer**: Once taken one of the [[Structuralism & Categories (Tracks & Roles)#Background Tracks]], they expose it in the most clear way possible and keeping touch with people writing on the respective [[Structuralism & Categories (Tracks & Roles)#Claim Tracks]].
### The Current Team: 16.10

I send to the relevant groupchat the following message:
	Heyy!! I am organising a research project in the intersection of Category Theory and Philosophy of Science, we're currently three people planning to work on the project and some more joining for the reading. If you want to join us for the reading (mostly during this 2nd block) or for the writing (during January and potentially beginning of the next semester, ~6 - 12EC), feel free to text me and I'll give you some more infos and give a look at: https://horreum.pages.dev/1.-Active--and--Works/Master/5th-Semester/Research-Project/Structuralism--and--Categories-(Homepage)

- Me (Mathematical Logic and Philosophy) 15EC
- Jennifer (Theoretical Physics) 15EC?
- Minzhe (Logic & Philosophy (?)) 6EC?

Perhaps:
- Ridrigo (Category Theory)

Not really to be considered as active participants:
- Josje (Math Logic) 6EC?
- Bardo (Math Logic) 6EC

### New Team: Just me
The participation of people has been disappointing (predictably?) and now I plan to organise the project by myself, if Minzhe also wants it (probably not) he will do smth by himself. I therefore send the following email to Benno:

Dear Benno,

I have consulted with the other people willing to take part in the project and we came to the conclusion that it is best, at least for now, for only me to officially register for the project for credits and then commit to the writing. The other students are currently planning to come to the reading appointments (currently scheduled for once a week) generally prefer to give it more time and read more into the literature before committing for the project. Let me know then how to proceed with the registration for only me for the 6EC project and if there is any further information you need (my data, abstract of the project, calendar...).

I also have another question on a completely different topic, I am currently planning on doing the math-track and was wondering whether you think I would be eligible for being exempted from the courses in Model Theory and Set Theory since I already had similar courses during the bachelor. More precisely, I took a course in Model Theory, see: 
https://horreum.pages.dev/1.-Active--and--Works/Bachelor/2nd-Semester/Mathematics/Lecture-Notes/Model-Theory-(Lecture)

And for Set Theory: 
https://horreum.pages.dev/1.-Active--and--Works/Bachelor/2nd-Semester/Mathematics/Lecture-Notes/Advanced-Set-Theory-(Lecture)

There you can find summarised the topics we had in the courses. I am not entirely sure that I want to be exempted from those courses, since it may be good for me to recap the material once more, since I took these courses during my second semester of the bachelor; so please consider this more as an informal request just to see if I could exempted.

Thank you and best,
Simone

I store the old pages in a new folder which I will delete when I forget about it.
## Registration and Proper Planning
In order to register the project I had to submit these two brief descriptions, one to Benno and the other one to Tugba. The description will need to contain a list of the aims of the project and a brief description of the context.
	The project centres on the intersection of Philosophy of Science and Category Theory, with a particular focus on structuralism, both in physics and beyond. It aims to offer a comprehensive framework for understanding scientific theories through categorical perspectives, particularly emphasising categorical structuralism and Morita equivalence. Rather than merely cataloguing these sources, the work synthesises key arguments, such as those found in "What Scientific Theories Could not Be" (Halvorson, 2012), which critiques traditional syntactic and semantic views of scientific theories. Other significant contributions include Halvorson's 2013 work on theoretical equivalence, providing insights into structural and syntactic parallels in theory formation. 
	The project also engages with categorical approaches to structuralism by analysing works like "Categories of Scientific Theories" (Halvorson & Tsementzis, 2015) and exploring how Morita equivalence offers a nuanced understanding of theoretical identity. This categorical perspective allows for a formal treatment of structuralism that extends beyond physics, encompassing mathematics and even the philosophy of mind.
	 The output of the project will be a text that not only summarises contemporary literature but also advances new ideas and addresses unresolved issues in the philosophical and categorical understanding of scientific theories. The general approach to structuralism and each one of the philosophical topics treated will be particularly formal, in the attempt of clarifying notions that result not as transparent in their informal formulation.

\begin{argument}[Argument (Authors)]\footnote{\q{So the primary question to pose is the one about how we are able to know graphs as $G'$ to exist. But that question can be answered in more or less standard ways: because graph theory postulates it and we have every reason to believe that the basic principles of graph theory are coherent; because we can generate graphical templates that indicate so; and so forth. In particular, we can just consider the one node graph and apply the standard graph theoretic operation of adding a node, or we consider e.g. the two node directed graph and apply the operation of removing an edge. Hence, there is no real problem here, at least not over and above general epistemological worries about pattern structuralism the discussion of which would lead us far beyond the aims of this paper. (We think of questions such as: What does ‘coherent’ mean? How are we able to know structures on the basis of templates? Etc.)} p.5}

They say:

        \item If $=$ is a \txr{logical relation}, then $=$ is as structural as existence or other logical concepts
        \item If $=$ is a mathematical relation, $PII_{\Lgr^=} \not \To |\c{D}_{\c{G}'}| = 1$

\end{Proposition}
\begin{argument}
    \begin{quote}
        If the identity relation and the distinctness relation between nodes in a graph  are  logical  relations,  then the  fact  that  a  structure  does  or  does  not  satisfy  certain identity claims is  just as structural as the fact that it has various properties which can be expressed  by  other  logical  concepts,  such  as  existence,  or  by  combinations  thereof.  On the  other  hand,  if  the  identity  relation  for  nodes  in  a  graph  is  a  genuinely  mathematical relation, then – just as it is the case for every other mathematical relation – a structuralist ought to regard it as belonging to the very structure the places of which it does or does not  relate.
    \end{quote}
\end{argument}

\begin{redQuestion}
    A logical relation, if I recall correctly, is a relation that is interpreted always in the same way, i.e. one that has been defined metalinguistically. That is, assuming $PII_\c{L}$ is one way of saying that $=$ has been taken to be logical.
\end{redQuestion}

\begin{definition}[Set-Theoretic Definition of $G'$]
    $\b{G}' := \{\{x, y\}, \emptyset\}$

    $\b{G}'$ exists.

\begin{argument}[Argument (me)]
    $G'$ exists and we can note that by the T-Schema, $G'$ satisfies all properties of $\c{G}'$
\end{argument}

\begin{attdefinition}[Graph-Theoretic Definition of $G'$]
    $\c{G}$' is an arbitrary structure in the class of models of $T_{G'} = \{\ex{x}\ex{y} \fa{z} ((z = x \o z = y) \a \n x = y, \fa{x}\fa{y} \n x R y, \fa{\lambda \in \Lambda} \}$
\end{attdefinition}

\begin{redQuestion}
    Are we really sure that we are allowed to have \q{$=$}?
\end{redQuestion}

\newpage
\begin{quote}
    The actual question is: how do we know that there is an unlabelled graph with exactly two nodes and no edges? Once it is established that such a graph exists, then we can conclude that there is a unique such graph, since isomorphic structures are deemed to be identical according to the tenets of pattern structuralism. We would call this graph $G'$, and our knowledge of what $G'$ is like would be sufficient in order to know of every node $x$ in $G'$ that there is another node $y$ in $G'$ such that $x \neq y$ and that every node in $G'$ is either identical to $x$ or $y$, i.e.: $G'$ consists of exactly two nodes.
\end{quote}

\begin{rephrasing}[1]
    If $G'$ exists, then $G'$ consists of exactly two nodes.
\end{rephrasing}

\begin{rephrasing}[2]
    If $G'$ exists, then we have $\c{G}'$ defined in $\Lgr^=$ s.t. $\c{G}' \md \ex{x}\ex{y}(\n x = y \a \fa{z} (z = x \o z = y))$
\end{rephrasing}

\begin{redQuestion}
    What is the correct rephrasing? Note (2) $\To$ (1) (right?).
\end{redQuestion}

\begin{problem}
    Note that this requires me to add \q{$=$} to the language $\Lgr$, resulting in $\Lgr^=$. Note that, before assuming PII, \q{$=$} remains an illogical uninterpreted symbol (see Quine in BA Thesis).
\end{problem}

This says that, if we define the graph informally, then we will be able to prove the wished properties of that graph.



The wished graphs, as showed in natural language, exists. 
\begin{redQuestion}
    Does it mean that $G'$ is definable in $\Lgr$? I.e. that $\c{G}'$ exists?
\end{redQuestion}

\newpage

\begin{quote}
    Since permuting the two nodes of $G'$ obviously leaves the graph unchanged, $G'$ allows for non-trivial automorphisms. Yet there is no irreflexive relation that may be used to ground the identity or difference of the nodes in accordance with the weak version of PII, nor is there any need of doing so; in the eyes of the graph theorist, the two nodes in $G'$ are perfectly respectable mathematical objects for which it is determinately true that they are distinct from each other. The fact that $G'$ consists of precisely two nodes is simply part of what $G'$ is, it is “built into” its graph theoretic structure. Adapting the structuralist slogan on natural numbers (as stated, for example, in MacBride [2005], p. 583), we are still allowed to say that “There is no more to the individual nodes ‘in themselves’ than the relations they bear to each other”, the only addition that we have to make is that we have to count identity and difference of nodes among the very relations that the nodes in a graph bear to each other. There is also no worry about whether we thereby ascribe any non-structural properties to unlabelled graphs: If the identity relation and the distinctness relation between nodes in a graph are logical relations, then the fact that a structure does or does not satisfy certain identity claims is just as structural as the fact that it has various properties which can be expressed by other logical concepts, such as existence, or by combinations thereof. On the other hand, if the identity relation for nodes in a graph is a genuinely mathematical relation, then – just as it is the case for every other mathematical relation – a structuralist ought to regard it as belonging to the very structure the places of which it does or does not relate.
\end{quote}

\newpage
\begin{definition}[Graph-Theoretic Definition of $G'$]
    $\c{G}$' is an arbitrary structure in the class of models of $\{\}$
\end{definition}

\begin{redQuestion}
    I am using $=$ and I cant, its not supposed to be in the language (or is it?). I should also specify that none of the points of the graph has a label, can I do that without identity? Perhaps $\Lambda$ as a set of predicates $P_\lambda(x) \rightsquigarrow$ $x$ is named $\lambda$.
\end{redQuestion}

\begin{statement}
    $\c{G}'$ exists.
\end{statement}
\begin{argument}[Argument (me)]
    $G'$ exists and we can note that by the T-Schema, $G'$ satisfies both formulae, hence there is such a $\c{G}'$ since the theory is consistent. It is easy to show that the theory is categorical, hence $\c{G}'$ is well-defined.
\end{argument}

\begin{redQuestion}
    Is this the Graph-Theoretic definition of $G'$?
\end{redQuestion}

    $f_\epsilon: \{x, y\} \to \{x, y\}, x \mapsto y, y \mapsto x$
\end{definition}
Note that $f_\epsilon$ is trivially an automorphism $f_\epsilon : \b{G}' \to \b{G}'$.

\begin{definition}[Attempted Graph-Theoretic Automorphism]
    $f_{gr}: \c{D} \to \c{D}$, for $\c{D}$ the domain of $\c{G}'$, s.t. $\fa{x} f_{gr}(x) \not = x$
\end{definition}
The requirement on $f_{gr}$ shows that it is not it is not the trivial automorphism. Since $f_{gr}$ is a function, it must map $x$ and $y$, and it cannot but invert them, since they are the only two objects in the domain.

\begin{redQuestion}
    This is a wrong definition, \q{$=$} is not in $\c{L}_{gr}$, nor it can be defined. How to solve?
\end{redQuestion}

\begin{definition}[Graph-Theoretic Automorphism]
    $f_{gr}: \c{D} \to \c{D}$, for $\c{D}$ the domain of $\c{G}'$, s.t. $\fa{x} f_{gr}(x) \not =_\epsilon x$
\end{definition}
Here note that \q{$=_\epsilon$} is a symbol defined in $\c{L}_\epsilon$, which also gives foundations to the definition of $\c{L}_{gr}$ it self, a structure in that language has a domain that is a set with elements and equality of these elements is defined set-theoretically.

\begin{redQuestion}
    Are we sure that this is okay? I am saying that \q{$f_{gr}(x)$} and \q{$x$} are sets, and I note \q{$\fa{x \in \c{D}_{gr}} f_{gr}(x) = x$}$\in \Le$. This should allow a metalinguistic (i.e. using $\Le$ instead of $\c{L}_{gr}$) definition of $f_{gr}$.
\end{redQuestion}

\subsection*{Failure of weak PII}
\begin{definition}[Second Order Weak Principle of Identity of Indiscernibles]
    $\fa{F} \fa{x, y}((F(x) \tot F(y)) \to x = y)$
\end{definition}
\noindent Note that this is a in second order logic.

\begin{definition}[Metalinguistic Weak Principle of Identity of Indiscernibles]
    $\fa{\vf \in \c{L}}\fa{x, y}((\vf(x) \tot \vf(y)) \to x = y$
\end{definition}

\noindent Note that this is a metalinguistic formula written $\Le$.

\begin{theorem}
    $f_{gr}(x) \not =_\epsilon x$ but 
\end{theorem}
