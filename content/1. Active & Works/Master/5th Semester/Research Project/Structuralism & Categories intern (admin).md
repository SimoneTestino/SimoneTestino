### People
- Josje: Technical Categor-Theoretic parts should be supervised by her.
- Bardo: Might be the only one I know to also be able to work on the intersection of both fields
- Jennifer: Physics!! But also Philosophy
**I should ask to**:
- David: Category Theory (idk if he knows / cares about phi.sci)
- PHYSICIANS!!
- spam in groupchats with google form.

# TODO
- [x] Write to Chinese cool guy
- [ ] Spam messages around (?)
- [ ] Make undecided people decide 
- [ ] Bureaucratic confirmation from Jennifer
- [x] To: Cinti & Tugba, can you supervise?
- [x] Update team's page


Beuracracy:
- One project supervised by Benno & Enrico, 6EC to each one of the participants
- One project supervised by Enrico only, 6 - 9 ECs to each one of the participants (Q: can Enrico supervise the project?)

## Rumenta

- Max: a little but no
- Josje: interested
- ask Sittoni, has 
- tipo tedesco interessato

To do after upload:
1. spamma ad amici
2. mail a prof (magari dopo averci parlato post lezione)

### Questions
##### First Organisation Steps towards Realisation
1. Ask Dr. Sebastian de Haro Ollé and Prof. Benno van den Berg for approval
	1. Is it doable with satisfactory depth and completeness in 6 weeks? (I am counting Christmas vacation, in which I will begin reading the literature and determine potential research tracks for other students to collaborate)
	2. Do you have any literature to suggest? (Perhaps other related topics, or further papers in the same field. It would also help to have, particularly on the categorical side, some introduction to the technical skills required)
	3. Do you have any member of ILLC or other researcher to suggest? (Could be both for co-supervision or just for a one-time discussion on the topic with me and potentially other students involved)
	4. Does the field I described well fit your research interests? (Connected to the question above, if the field were not within your field of research, do you have somebody else to suggest, within or outside of the ILLC?)
	5. How many EC would you estimate? (Considering the remarks made above on the amount of pages the work will consist of, hours I plan to invest in and papers I plan to read before)
		6. How does participation of other students influence it? (considering that it would imply a proportionally larger amount of work, not delegation of present work but development of new ideas and branches of research)
2. Team Coordination
	1. Begin to read some literature, whatever is vaguely needed to make the sketch of a plan.
	2. Share this page to the group-chats of Category Theory and Philosophy of Science and search students willing to join the project.
		1. Make a [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdx_ATY579NgdwSeGapf1_-P9XYiqg6BDwgNxsD1U4_V4FzEA/viewform?usp=sf_link) with interests, competence area and background and select in case too many people wanted to participate.
	3. Schedule from two to five discussion-meetings with the other students on those papers that will be relevant for the project, in order of priority:
		1. [[Halvorson, H. (2012), What Scientific Theories Could not Be]]
		2. [Criteria of Identity and Structural Ontology](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hannes-Leitgeb-2/publication/31349684_Criteria_of_Identity_and_Structuralist_Ontology/links/00463534fdb154f8b7000000/Criteria-of-Identity-and-Structuralist-Ontology.pdf?origin=publicationDetail&_sg%5B0%5D=ulrFKJxSo5jaNeCcC_G-SfIm5cfSOghXDvamINp01-TwUpbBUL2LZjzXUmEE_TSkJL4KY8RIQLMb78iVP7Yv9g.d4mRcbQrbo2MXHb7VkwdtNFfg3MZgisp3B7yGzzuAeAobShv-_XM3l4jFIBw5uU7fLgm5lNQGoWR08qbtX3w3g&_sg%5B1%5D=h_I-RdO0AXbmNUQr62JiRf-9ii05sny7fCG1xftvDZBrgPNtrjcbRebTln1M1wXcSNT3eNjdXzOCy3RgIQZTt-cSGX6SxWoaeZzrtxlZotb0.d4mRcbQrbo2MXHb7VkwdtNFfg3MZgisp3B7yGzzuAeAobShv-_XM3l4jFIBw5uU7fLgm5lNQGoWR08qbtX3w3g&_iepl=&_rtd=eyJjb250ZW50SW50ZW50IjoibWFpbkl0ZW0ifQ%3D%3D&_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIiwicGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIiwicG9zaXRpb24iOiJwYWdlSGVhZGVyIn19) (?)
		3. One text selected by [[Bas van Fraassen]]
		4. Eventually, for discussion: (agree or disagree with my strong position)
			1. [[Structure on Models]]
			2. [[Horsten, L. (2010), Having an Interpretation]]
	4. Have a final discussion so that, by the end of it, only those students that have their own topic of research are selected and combine a complete plan of the whole research project.
		1. Each student shall have their own plan and schedule
			- This will be submitted before the begin of the Christmas Vacation to the supervisors so that they can estimate the EC that will be assigned to each one of the students.
		2. We organise some check-points during the 3rd period so that we can discuss the present state of the work.

###### Category Theory
- Do you think that the literature on Morita Equivalence is accessible to students who completed the course in Category Theory? If not, is there some resource you would suggest to get to the required level?
- It may be useful to have some knowledge on the processes used to _translate_ the mathematical praxis from the familiar set-theoretic foundation to the categorical one. In particular, this may be employed to have a more _categorical_ understanding of those scientific theories which have already been formalised in standard (hence set-theoretic) mathematics. I imagine such a literature may be found in categorical foundations of mathematics.
###### Philosophy of Science
Most literature questions have already been addressed, new ones will certainly come up.

### Calendar
The calendar I write here has as constrains not only those listed in [[Structuralism & Categories (Supervisor's Page)#Bureaucracy]] but also, and more importantly, those for my [[PhD Applications in the US]]; and this is because I plan to use this research project to produce the writing sample I will need to write for such applications. This will though not affect the general submission date, which will anyway be set during January
- **November**
	- 1st Week: 28.10 - 3.11
		- I familiarised with the literature on Structuralism and have understood its applications in different contexts, from Sciences to Mathematics but also with Philosophy of Mind (see [[Philosophy of Cognition (Lecture)]], assignment 1).
		- I have then decided to keep the generality of the project as high as possible, in order to attempt claims in different fields.
		- I also wrote down the general index of the project.
	- 2nd Week: 4.11 - 10.11
		- I write down a syntactical distinction of intrinsic and extrinsic properties and give a formal definition to structuralism.
			- In particular I motivate how my formal understanding of it relates with the literature I read.
			- I also focus on giving a formal account of [[Leitgeb, H., Ladyman, J. (2007), Criteria of Identity and Structuralist Ontology]].
		- I reconsider and rewrite my arguments in [[Structure on Models]], [[Horsten, L. (2010), Having an Interpretation]], [[Halvorson, H. (2012), What Scientific Theories Could not Be]] and [[Halvorson, H. (2013), The semantic view, if plausible, is syntactic]].
		- I read: [[Halvorson, H., Barrett, T. (2015), Glymour and Quine on Theoretical Equivalence]].
	- 3rd Week: 11.11 - 17.11
		- I read: [[Halvorson, H. (2015), Morita Equivalence]], [[Halvorson, H., Tsementzis, D. (2015), Categories of Scientific Theories]] and [nLab Morita Equivalence](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Morita+equivalence).
	- 4th Week: 18.11 - 24.11
	- 5th Week: 25.11 - 1.12
- **December**
	- 1st Week: 2.12 - 8.12
		- I have a written sample that can be submitted for the [[PhD Applications in the US]] of about 20 - 25 pages. I discuss with the supervisors if this is sufficient for both submissions, see [[Structuralism & Categories (Supervisor's Page)#Bureaucracy]].
	- 2nd Week: 9.12 - 15.12
	- 3rd Week: 16.12 - 22.12
	- 4th Week: 23.12 - 29.12
	- 5th Week: 30.12 - 5.1
- **January**
	- 1st Week: 6.1 - 12.1
	- 2nd Week: 13.1 - 19.1
	- 3rd Week: 20.1 - 26.1
	- 4th Week: 27.1 - 2.2
