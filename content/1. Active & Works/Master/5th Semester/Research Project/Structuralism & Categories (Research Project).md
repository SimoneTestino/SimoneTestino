title: Categorical Foundations of Structuralism
---
During my [[5th Semester#1st Year, 3rd Period]] of my [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]], I did a research project I want to pursue in the thin, though currently wider than ever, intersection between Philosophy of Science and Category Theory. I proposed this research project to both Dr. Enrico Cinti (researcher in Philosophy of Science at the ILLC and University of Geneva) and Prof. Benno van den Berg (lecturer of [[Category Theory (Lecture)]]), more on the bureaucratic state of the project can be found on the [[Structuralism & Categories (Supervisor's Page)]], I will here mainly focus on its content and relation with my past work.

The current updated version of the project can be found here: [Overleaf: S&C Main](https://www.overleaf.com/read/dwgzfwywxddp#d1e16f).

In this page I present the general procedure that led me to the writing of the project, I start by presenting the [[Structuralism & Categories (Research Project)#Main Literature References]], and by outlining the [[Structuralism & Categories (Research Project)#Calendar]] I follow for the reading and writing phases.
### Main Literature References
I organise the reading so that there will be an open dialogue with a little group of other students of the [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]] who are planning to do research in this field.
