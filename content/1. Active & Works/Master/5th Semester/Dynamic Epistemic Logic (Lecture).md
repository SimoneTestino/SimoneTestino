I followed this course by, Prof. Baltag during my [[5th Semester]] at the [[ILLC Amsterdam]] for my [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]]. A full description of the course can be found [here](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2024-2025-en/search-course/course/118845). My solutions to the assignments are available at: [Overleaf: DEL](https://www.overleaf.com/read/tpjxkfdsszyv#c3c12f). For the final valuation of this course I worked on this project [[De Re Knowledge of Arbitrary Objects]].
