I wrote my bachelor thesis with the title *A Formal Approach to Syntactic Structures: Language Theory as a Field in Mathematical Logic*. The full version of the thesis can be found at [Overelaf: B.A. Thesis](https://www.overleaf.com/read/xbnycxdxjthm#a99d49), this work syntheses both version officially submitted, for the [[B.A. Philosophy (LMU)]] and for the [[B.Sc. Mathematics (LMU)]], these are respectively to be found at [[B.A. Philosophy Thesis]] and [[B.Sc. Mathematics Thesis]].

I wrote this work during my [[4th Semester]], from April to July 2023, at the [[LMU Munich]] under supervision of Dr. Dougherty from the MCMP first and then by Prof. Merkl (department of Mathematics of the [[LMU Munich]]) and Prof. Schuster from the University of Verona (former lecturer at the [[LMU Munich]]).

After the [presentation](https://projects.illc.uva.nl/lgc/seminar/2024/10/lira-session-johan-van-benthem-5/) by Prof. [van Bentham](https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/organisation/professors/emertitus-university-professors/johan-van-benthem.html) at the [[ILLC Amsterdam]] on Translation Theory on the 21st November 2024, I decided to invest my research of the [[Master Thesis]] on his literature I was unaware of while writing the bachelor thesis.
