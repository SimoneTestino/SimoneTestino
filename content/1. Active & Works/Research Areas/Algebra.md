I first studied algebra at the [[University of Constance]] at the start of my [[B.Sc. Mathematics (LMU)]] with the course in Linear Algebra I and then in [[Linear Algebra II (Lecture)]]. I then strengthen my skills at the [[LMU Munich]] with courses such as [[Algebra (Lecture)]] and [[Commutative Algebra (Lecture)]]. I am looking forward courses in Algebraic Number Theory, or Algebraic Geometry. Most relevantly though I am interested in fields of research that connect Algebra with [[Set Theory]] and [[Category Theory]] such as [Algebraic Set Theory](https://www.phil.cmu.edu/projects/ast/).
