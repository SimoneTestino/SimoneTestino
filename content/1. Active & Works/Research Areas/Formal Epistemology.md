I first explored formal epistemology through its connection to the philosophy of language at the [[University of Constance]], where I wrote the essay [[The Frequency of Telling Stories]]. I later received a stronger formal education in [[Modal Logic (Lecture)]] at the [[LMU Munich#MCMP]], part of the [[LMU Munich]], and a more mathematically rigorous training at the [[ILLC Amsterdam]] through the course [[Introduction to Modal Logic (Lecture)]].  

At the [[ILLC Amsterdam]], I also worked on research projects related to the topic as part of the course [[Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Lecture)]], focusing on the project [[De Re Knowledge of Arbitrary Objects]]. During my [[6th Semester]] I followed then the course [[Topology, Logic and Learning (Lecture)]].

I see this area as tightly connected with [[Formal Cognitive Sciences]].
