I have been first introduced to formal structures during introductory courses in the [[B.Sc. Mathematics (LMU)]] and have first taken a course in [[Model Theory (Lecture)]] at the [[University of Constance]] during my [[2nd Semester]]. During my [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]] I followed the course [[Model Theory, ILLC (Lecture)]] as part of the Mathematics Track during my [[6th Semester]]. I have also followed and presented at the seminar [[Logic and Probability (Lecture)]] where I applied some of these notions. This fields also connects with [[Set Theory]] and in particular [[Forcing (Research Project)]].
