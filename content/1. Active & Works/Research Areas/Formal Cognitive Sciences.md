I currently have very little experience in this research field and got first introduced by the course [[Philosophy of Cognition (Lecture)]] at the [[ILLC Amsterdam]] and wrote [[Ontic Structuralism of Concepts]], for which I read some literature in the field. This field certainly relates with my work on [[Formal Epistemology]].
