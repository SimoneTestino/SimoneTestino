Starting my [[6th Semester]] in January, I find myself with many things that I left unfinished and now need to complete in order to finish my [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]] within one year and still meet all the requirements I listed in [[Assume I finish the MoL in one year, what then]]. On this page, I attempt to bring some order to my thoughts regarding the most important tasks I need to complete before starting and focusing on the thesis. For this reason, this list neglects both the [[Master Thesis]] and all courses of the [[6th Semester]], as my priority is first to ensure that all tasks from the [[5th Semester]] are completed.

Since my concern is not whether I should complete these tasks, but rather when and with what priority they should be done, I have organised the list by deadlines, noting how flexible they are and which advantages I gain by completing some tasks earlier than others.

- [[Category Theory (Lecture)]] Exam  
	- **Deadline**: 20.01  

- [[Ontic Structuralism of Concepts]]  
	- **Deadline**: 24.01  
	- I already have a well-formed idea for the essay and just need to write it down. It is not a particularly challenging or technical essay, so I expect to finish it easily before the deadline, if not sooner.  

- [[De Re Knowledge of Arbitrary Objects]]  
	- **Deadline**: 31.01  
	- This project is my highest priority—not because the deadline is strict (as it could potentially be postponed by months), but because I already have a clear plan for how to proceed. I aim to create a submission-worthy project for conferences (though I am not assuming acceptance) and to position it as a potential publication for the [[PhD Applications]].  

- [[Forcing (Research Project)]] Presentation  
	- **Deadline**: 07.02  
	- The date has been fixed. I will handle the introductory part and, as a result, will not need to prepare much additional material.  

- [[A Topological Approach to Infinite Disjunctions]]  
	- **Deadline**: 08.02  
	- I will finalise the idea for this project while working on [[De Re Knowledge of Arbitrary Objects]]. My plan is to submit the essay by the first week of February.  

- [[Introduction to Modal Logic (Lecture)]] Exam  
	- **Deadline**: 20.02  
	- This exam covers a substantial amount of material and will significantly impact my final average (see [[Track of the MSc. Logic]]). Therefore, I will dedicate all my time after the [[Forcing (Research Project)]] presentation to its preparation.  

- [[Forcing (Research Project)]] Exercises  
	- **Deadline**: 25.02  
	- There is no strict deadline for these exercises. I will work on them after completing the [[Introduction to Modal Logic (Lecture)]] exam.  

- [[Structuralism & Categories (Research Project)]] Cinti  
	- **Deadline**: 28.02  
	- I will complete this project by incorporating parts of previously written essays and submitting the final work.  

- [[Master Thesis]] Abstract & Project details submission
	- **Deadline**: 01.03

- [[Structuralism & Categories (Research Project)]] Benno  
	- **Deadline**: 10.03  
	- Starting with the work submitted for the same project under Cinti's supervision, I aim to deepen my understanding of Morita equivalence. I will conclude the project by adding a categorical perspective. However, due to time constraints and my desire to focus on writing the [[Master Thesis]] by this point, I will not be able to delve as deeply into the categorical details in the literature as I initially planned.
