I just received a **6** on the Dutch grading scale for my work on [[Ontic Structuralism of Concepts]], a paper I had even considered submitting to the mentioned conference. I then received detailed feedback from Giorgio on how to improve the essay (28.01.2025), despite the mark already being final, in case I still wanted to refine the project and submit it to the conference.

First of all, I remain dissatisfied with the feedback because it focuses solely on structure. I cannot see form as the most important aspect of a paper; this is not what I value in my own essays, nor what I believe others should value in any non-didactic context. Moreover, structuring a paper is something AI will soon be able to handle for us. I have already expressed these frustrations in [[What I don't Enjoy in Philosophical Writing]], so I will now focus on what to do next.

I wanted to submit the paper to the conference primarily to strengthen my [[PhD Applications]], especially given my reflections in [[PhD Applications Regrets]]. A submission would certainly help, as most [[PhD Applications in the US]] and some of the [[PhD Applications in the EU & UK]] accept post-submission materials, such as publications, which can aid the selection process.

Beyond deciding what to do with [[Ontic Structuralism of Concepts]], I also need to reconsider my approach to [[De Re Knowledge of Arbitrary Objects]]. I had planned to dedicate a similar amount of time to that project, but it may not be wise to do so again if it is likely to receive a similarly low mark. However, given the tight schedule outlined in [[Finishing the Fifth Semester, Deadlines and Priorities]], it might be best to complete this second project and hope for the best.

As for the first issue, I think it would be best to prioritise [[Finishing the Fifth Semester, Deadlines and Priorities]] and, if I find the time, dedicate a day or two to restructuring and improving the paper. This could be done alongside preparation for the [[Introduction to Modal Logic (Lecture)]] exam, as some of the writing will complement the mathematical learning required for the exam. I will aim to retain the core ideas of the paper while following Sbardolini’s detailed suggestions and then submit it both to the conference and as part of my [[PhD Applications]]. I expect to complete this by mid-February, which will still be in time for all the [[PhD Applications in the US]]. Moreover, if I receive rejections before then, it would likely indicate that I was not even close to being admitted, in which case a potential publication would not have made a difference anyway.

I found out that a resit for the course is possible, I attach below the email conversation, which was certainly very helpful: [[Emails, Giorgio Sbardolini, 30012025.pdf]].

Given that the topic of the resit must necessarily be different, I consider writing something to add-on to the current project which may then be submitted for the conference as a union of both the current revisited essay together with the new one to be submitted for the resit. This requires more work and could not fit well in the [[Finishing the Fifth Semester, Deadlines and Priorities]] and hence not be made in time for the [[PhD Applications]]. I will soon think about the potential topics, I listed interesting literature in [[Formal Cognitive Sciences]], and will then ask Giorgio whether these are compatible with the requirements of the course.
