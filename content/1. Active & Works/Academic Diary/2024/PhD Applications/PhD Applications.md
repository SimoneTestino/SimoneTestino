Following the reasoning outlined in [[Assume I finish the MoL in one year, what then]], I started applying for PhD positions in both the US and Europe. To manage the process efficiently, I created separate pages for the two regions:
- [[PhD Applications in the US]]
- [[PhD Applications in the EU & UK]]

These pages primarily serve as organisational tools to help me track everything during the application process. Additionally, I decided to consolidate all attachments relevant to multiple applications onto one page, making it easier to upload files and ensure the correct functionality of links when submitting forms. All these documents have been stored in [[Attachments to PhD Applications]].

To manage the required information and ensure that all recommendation letters were handled properly, I created a dedicated page for [[Information for Recommenders]].

Lastly, I set up a page to record the [[PhD Applications Results]]. Some more personal details about how I handled the application process is also maid available in my [[Academic Diary]] in the respective year [[Academic Diary#2024/25]]. I took often into account the positions posted on the [ILLC Open Positions](https://www.illc.uva.nl/NewsandEvents/News/Positions/), [MathJobs](https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs), [MasterMath](https://elo.mastermath.nl/mod/page/view.php?id=12749), [Marie Curie Fellowship](https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/jobs/search?f%5B0%5D=job_is_eu_founded%3A4348&f%5B1%5D=job_is_eu_founded%3A4349&f%5B2%5D=job_research_field%3A298&f%5B3%5D=job_research_field%3A299&f%5B4%5D=job_research_field%3A332&f%5B5%5D=job_research_profile%3A447&f%5B6%5D=positions%3Amaster_positions&f%5B7%5D=positions%3Aphp_positions&page=2) and [ScandinavianLogicSociaety](https://scandinavianlogic.org/positions.html).
