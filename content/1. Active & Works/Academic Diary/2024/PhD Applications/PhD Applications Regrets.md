I began working on the applications in early November and completed most of the attachments by early December to be ready for the first submission to [[PhD Applications in the US#Princeton]]. In hindsight, I regret not spending enough time on the [[Writing_Sample.pdf]], which was part of my [[Bachelor Thesis]]. The quality of this work was subpar, receiving a 2.7 for the [[B.A. Philosophy Thesis]] and a 2.0 for the [[B.Sc. Mathematics Thesis]], grades that are unlikely to be competitive for Ivy League schools.

Beyond the writing sample, I am not confident about the recommendation letters. The recommenders were either not well-acquainted with my work or did not have a strong belief in it, which diminishes my confidence in their letters.

Additionally, I believe I did not devote sufficient effort to crafting the statements of purpose. I did not upload them here because I tailored each one to specific universities, highlighting the professors and research groups of interest. However, these statements were never thoroughly revised or polished.

Furthermore, I regret not considering a broader range of universities in the process. While I selected some institutions from the [Philosophical Gourmet](https://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/philosophy-of-the-sciences-and-mathematics/) ranking for Philosophy of Mathematics and Mathematical Logic, I should have conducted more extensive research and applied to more universities. Omitting institutions like [[PhD Applications in the US#Berkeley University]] was certainly a poor decision, though necessary due to the late stage at which I decided to apply for PhD positions, the overarching goal of completing the [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]] within a year (see [[Assume I finish the MoL in one year, what then]]), and the overall [[Master's Outline]].

I remain uncertain whether putting in more effort would have altered the [[PhD Applications Results]]. Finally, it is important to note that my current motivation and clarity about my future academic path are uncertain, as reflected in [[Is it the Begin of a Motivational Decline]].

\[20.02.2025\] I later realised that for [[PhD Applications in the US#Notre Dame]] I should have applied to the HPS track and not to the general Philosophy PhD since the application process is different. \[22.02.2025\] I got in fact rejected.

\[22.02.2025\] Another thing I regret is applying only to PhD programmes in Philosophy. Since my [[Research Areas]] lie between the two fields, and I would be happy working in either department (or even in a Computer Science department), it would have made much more sense to apply to multiple programmes per university (where allowed). I also wish I had applied to a wider range of universities, including those with lower prestige in the USA.
