I have an interview scheduled for the 25th of February 2025 for a PhD position in [[PhD Applications in the EU & UK#Konstanz]]. Over the next few days, I intend to gather some thoughts here to assess the value of this position for me. This will also serve as an initial attempt to establish criteria for evaluating PhD positions, helping me develop a structured framework for assessing the remaining [[PhD Applications Results]], which I expect to receive in the coming month.

My first priority is to determine whether I am genuinely interested in the proposed project. Immediately after, I need to evaluate the potential supervisor and consider how this position might be perceived in future academic applications. Beyond these aspects, it will be important to assess other opportunities at the university, such as the overall appeal of the department and the possibility of collaborating with other professors during my PhD. Finally, I will reflect on broader factors related to quality of life, including salary, living conditions in the city, and how well the position aligns with my personal and professional goals.
##### Interest in the Project
The general project, as outlined on the [page](https://www.emanueledosualdo.com/research/positions/), only partially overlaps with my main [[Research Areas]]. However, it may intersect more with certain topics of interest, as described in [[An Interesting Field, Finite Model Theory]]. My knowledge of the field is somewhat limited—the closest related course I have taken is [[Constructive Analysis (Lecture)]] with [[Helmut Schwichtenberg]], which I studied through [Minlog](https://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~logik/minlog/). From a theoretical perspective, this course did not particularly interest me. On the other hand, [[Proof Theory (Lecture)]] was highly engaging, and I would be keen to explore this area further. Before the interview, I plan to investigate the research topic in more depth to make a more informed assessment.
##### University  
Regarding the university, it does not have the same level of recognition as most of the institutions I applied to in the USA (see [[PhD Applications in the US]]). Despite this, I have a very positive view of the [[University of Constance]], primarily due to the research group led by [[Leon Horsten]], whose research interests align closely with mine.  
##### General Life Quality and Financials
According to the information provided on the [page](https://www.emanueledosualdo.com/research/positions/), the salary is set at the German E 13 TV-L 100% scale, which should amount to approximately [€2.812](https://oeffentlicher-dienst.info/c/t/rechner/tv-l/west?id=tv-l&g=E_13) per month. Given my previous expenses in Konstanz during the [[1st Semester]] and [[2nd Semester]]—which I recorded in [[Personal Finance (old)]] and found to be slightly above €500—it appears that this position would allow for significant savings. This financial situation may even be more favourable than what I could expect from a position in the USA and is comparable to other European PhD positions I have applied to.

\[11.02.2025\] I would be saving about €2,000 a month, €24,000 a year, totaling €100,000 for the first 4 years. Adding this to my current savings and accounting for average investment returns, I would have €200,000 at the age of 25, along with a PhD in computer science, which would allow me to secure a far better salary for the future years. The financial perspective, even under these [[Suboptimal Scenarios for PhD Applications]], is particularly good.

### Preparing for the Interview
To prepare effectively for the interview, I should identify the common research areas between my own [[Research Areas]] and those found in [Emanuele Dosualdo's Research](https://www.emanueledosualdo.com/research/). Below, I outline some of these connections.

The most immediate connection relates to what might become my [[Master Thesis]], namely [[Translation Theory]]. There appears to be some notion of translation in parts of his research, particularly in [DimSum](https://www.emanueledosualdo.com/research/papers/2022/dimsum.html), where the approach is described as _multilanguage_. My understanding of this notion is quite limited, as I am not entirely sure of the paper's overall content, but there may be some points of contact.

A paper where I struggled to grasp the main ideas is [Proving Hypersafety Compositionality](https://www.emanueledosualdo.com/research/papers/2022/hypersafety.html). I could barely follow beyond the first page, which reinforces my belief that I lack the background to engage meaningfully with this research. The fact that I cannot simply pick up a paper in this field and understand it—unlike what I expect in more technical areas such as [[Model Theory]], [[Modal Logic]], and [[Set Theory]]—convinces me that I am not a strong fit for the position.

Looking at the [position description](https://www.emanueledosualdo.com/research/positions/), the only areas where I might be able to contribute are automatic proof search, which I encountered in [[Proof Theory (Lecture)]] and earlier in [[Helmut Schwichtenberg]]'s [[Constructive Analysis (Lecture)]], and possibly quantum programming. The latter could be an interesting field to explore, as understanding quantum logic and its mathematical foundations might not take too long. However, these are weak matches with my [[Research Areas]], and overall, I remain convinced that I am not an ideal candidate for the position.

To conclude, the main points I could mention regarding the position are:  
- I have reviewed most of the papers on your website, but I cannot simply open and read them due to my lack of a CS background.  
  - However, I am motivated to learn quickly.  
  - This might also be the case for most students coming from an MSc. (?)  
- [[Translation Theory]] is a field I want to explore further and could be readily applicable.  
- Beyond that, two areas interest me the most, though I have no expertise in them:  
  - **Automatic Proof Search** (some exposure through [[Proof Theory (Lecture)]] and MinLog by [[Helmut Schwichtenberg]])  
  - **Quantum Logic & Quantum Programming** (only a Summer School introduction during my BSc., though I could pursue a research project on the topic).  

The interview went as foreseen, there are difficulties in finding common interests and I will keep it as an option B depending on how the other [[PhD Applications Results]] go; this is not to say that I have any reason to believe that I have a particular high chance to get the position, even if I decided to, since there certainly are some other candidates.
