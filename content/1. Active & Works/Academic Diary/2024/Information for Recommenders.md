I write on this page information that will be of crucial importance for the three people writing the recommendation letters for my [[PhD Applications in the US]] and [[PhD Applications in the EU & UK]]. They are invited to read carefully the following page in which I first present my relevant past and [[Information for Recommenders#My Current Work]] and give some insights on the work to come. Following that, I will give all [[Information for Recommenders#Bureaucratic Instructions]] that are of central importance to submit the recommendation letters.
#### My Current Work
The shortest presentation of my work can be found in my [[Curriculum Vitae.pdf]]. For some more detail I suggest reading [[Fields_of_Competence_and_Research_13.12.24.pdf]] and [[Transcript_of_Records_MSc_Logic_13.12.24.pdf]]. Feel free to contact me for any further detail
#### What am I applying for?
Other than a few exception, which will be specified below (see [[Information for Recommenders#Submitted Recommendation Letters]]), I am applying to PhD positions in departments of Philosophy in the track _Logic and Philosophy of Science_, like for [Princeton](https://philosophy.princeton.edu/graduate/special-programs). In other cases, like for the [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/philosophy/graduate/phd/index.html) I am applying to programs in both the department of Mathematics and Philosophy in _Pure and Applied Logic_.
## Bureaucratic Instructions
I mention here some bureaucratic details that have been highlighted in the website of the universities I am applying to and which are important for the submission of the recommendation letters.
> [!todo] Notify me
> 
> Please do not forget to notify me as soon as you submitted one of the recommendation letters so that I will manage to keep track of them.

I will in fact keep track of the submitted recommendation letters here: [[Information for Recommenders#Submitted Recommendation Letters]].
#### Submitted Recommendation Letters
For each one of the universities I applied to I list the current state of the recommendation letter for each one of the recommenders, each letter has can either be _waiting for application_, _==waiting for submission==_ or _received_, you should then write the recommendation letter for those marked with the highlighted option. The deadline and further remarks will also be specified in the email the university will send you.
> [!warning] Not Received the Email from the Universities?
> 
> When you see here a university marked as _==waiting for submission==_ you should have already received an email from the university asking you to send the recommendation letter, if that were not the case, please notify me asap.
