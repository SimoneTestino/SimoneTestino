Following the [[Notes on China]] I asked to [Wang]([https://wangyanjing.com](https://wangyanjing.com/)) whether there was the possibility to come as a visiting student, here is the conclusion we got to after exchanging some emails:

> I asked the university, and we only have the so-called senior visiting student program which asks for 30000RMB tuition fee and a complicated procedure to apply (the deadline has passed for this year too).
> 
>As we don't have too many English courses to offer, I think it is not so attractive to enroll in such a program.
>
>On the other hand, if you are interested, we are happy to host you for a short visit (one or two weeks) at some point (you may give a talk as well), and we can take care of your hotel expenses.

The fact that they could take care of the hotel expenses is certainly very interesting as it would significantly lower the price of the whole trip. What I could do is plan a project that follows my [[Master Thesis]] and has to do with the literature by [Bokai Yao](https://en.phil.pku.edu.cn/people/faculty/logic/532893.htm) and present it there. If the costs of the hotel are going to be covered for two weeks, I will have expenses related to flights and food only, I consider those aspects in the folder [[Trips]], in [[Beijing and Sydney]]
