title: Is it the Begin of a Motivational Decline?
---
What follows is a continuation of the [[Assume I finish the MoL in one year, what then]] given my past [[PhD Applications]].

The high uncertainty of the future and the accompanying stress, compounded by the intense pressure of the Masters (see [[Master's Outline]]), is causing me to question the pace at which I have conducted (see [[Bachelors' Outline]]) and am still conducting my studies. I will begin by presenting the current scenarios that lie ahead given the [[PhD Applications]], followed by some general uncertainties about which [[Research Areas]] I actually see myself working in the future.

### Upcoming Scenarios

I feel tense about the [[PhD Applications]], particularly the respective [[PhD Applications#Regrets]]. Two scenarios lie ahead of me: either I get good [[PhD Applications Results]] or bad ones. 

If I were to receive a good outcome, i.e., getting into at least one of the [[PhD Applications in the US]] (it seriously wouldn't matter which one, as they are all excellent), it would make me very happy and motivated. Finally achieving such a good result after all the effort during my Bachelor’s (see [[Bachelors' Outline]]) and Master's (see [[Master's Outline]]) would be incredibly rewarding. Being admitted to any of the universities I applied to in the USA would undoubtedly place me among the top 100 philosophers of my birth year, serving as a great motivator. Depending on the university faculty and the developments of my [[Master Thesis]] (which might depend on where I get admitted), I will decide on my area of specialisation. Currently, I am unsure of my precise path, as my [[Fields_of_Competence_and_Research_13.12.24.pdf]] outlines several different [[Research Areas]] I am interested in, without a clear favourite. My [[PhD Applications Results]] would primarily guide me in selecting a specific field, where I would then immerse myself while maintaining a broad perspective whenever possible.

The second scenario involves not being accepted by any of the [[PhD Applications in the US]] or Oxford and Cambridge in [[PhD Applications in the EU & UK]]. If this happens, I have three options.

Option one is to expand my [[PhD Applications in the EU & UK]], applying to more departments where I could pursue a project that continues my [[Master Thesis]]. Staying at [[ILLC Amsterdam]] or returning to [[LMU Munich]] would certainly be excellent options, along with other potential places like Vienna. If accepted, I would happily pursue a PhD at any of these institutions. If not, I would have to consider the next two options.

Option two is to accept one of the less optimal offers from the [[PhD Applications in the EU & UK]]. Each of these would need careful consideration, factoring in both living standards (which are excellent in places like [[PhD Applications in the EU & UK#Lund University]] or [[PhD Applications in the EU & UK#Denmark]]) and the academic career opportunities they would provide.

Option three is to remain enrolled in the [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]], staying at [[ILLC Amsterdam]], an excellent environment, to conduct more research projects aimed at leading to successful publications. This research year at ILLC Amsterdam would significantly enhance my chances for successful [[PhD Applications in the US]] the following year. This option should be weighed against the MA Philosophy at [[PhD Applications in the US#Simon Fraser University]], where I would receive a small salary but possibly be in a less stimulating environment. Financially, this option would be feasible (see [[Personal Finance (old)]]) with guaranteed support from my parents.

### What Will I Do?

I have always been very certain about what I wanted to study, but now, for the first time, I find myself unsure of my career prospects when faced with the choice of many [[Research Areas]] that excite me, despite all being closely related to my broader field of Theoretical Analytical Mathematical Philosophy and Mathematical Logic. Currently, given the scenarios presented above, I think that the department of the PhD programme I will end up in will be the one determining the main [[Research Areas]] I will specialise in.

This uncertainty adds complexity to the [[Master Thesis]], which currently has the topic on [[Translation Theory]], a subject I am genuinely interested in and find fruitful for many theoretical results in areas I am intrigued by. In conclusion, I am confident that I will find a field where I can excel and specialise, but I do not know what it is yet, and I feel like I have no clear means to determine it. The tools I used to determine my current focus were straightforward: I enjoy rational and abstract reasoning, so I pursued the most abstract and rational field available. Now, having discovered the diversity of abstract and rational fields, I am not equipped with the means to choose the one I want to dedicate the next several years to.
