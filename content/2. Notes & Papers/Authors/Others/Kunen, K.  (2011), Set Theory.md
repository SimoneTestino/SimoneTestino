The PDF of the book is available [here](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/khomskii/forcing2025/Kunen.pdf)..

I worked on [[Set Theory]] and specifically on this book in two courses, first in [[Advanced Set Theory (Lecture)]] at the [[University of Constance]] during my [[1st Semester]] and then in [[Forcing (Research Project)]] at the [[ILLC Amsterdam]] during my [[5th Semester]].

The older 1980 version is also available [here](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/khomskii/forcing2025/Kunen1980.pdf).
