In this folder, I collect notes on most of the papers I have read across various fields of interest, as well as the lecture notes I have taken for all courses I have attended since the beginning of my academic journey. Here, I focus on the more passive and learning-oriented aspects of academia, in contrast to my [[Academic Writings]].

A broader index of both my undergraduate and graduate work, listing all the courses I have taken along with the corresponding essays or research projects, can be found in [[Lecture Notes]].

- [[Index of Bachelor Works]] for [[B.A. Philosophy (LMU)]] & [[B.Sc. Mathematics (LMU)]]
- [[Index of Master Works]] for [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]]

I also maintain a record of the different [[Authors]] whose papers I have read, providing an index of all papers across the various disciplines in which I engage with academic literature.  

Additionally, I keep notes on the different [[Universities & Departments]] I have visited or been a part of as an active member, compiling my observations and reflections.
