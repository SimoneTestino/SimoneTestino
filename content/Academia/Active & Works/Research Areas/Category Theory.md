I got first introduced into Category Theory at the MCMP at the [[LMU Munich]] by John Dougherty in the course _Category Theory for the Working Philosopher_ for which I wrote [[Structure on Models]] getting acquainted with the literature by [[Hans Halvorson]]. I then followed for my [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]] at the ILLC the lecture [[Category Theory (Lecture)]] and worked with Benno van den Berg on a research project deepening my knowledge on the literature applying category theory to Philosophy of Science, [[Structuralism & Categories (Research Project)]]. Finally I used categorical methods also in my [[Master Thesis]] on Translation Theory as first suggested by Johan van Bentham.
