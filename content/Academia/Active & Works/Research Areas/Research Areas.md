During my undergraduate and graduate studies, I developed competence in a variety of fields, prioritising a broad focus over specialisation in a single topic. However, there are certain areas where my expertise has deepened significantly, which I list here, dividing them into mathematics and philosophy.  

On the page for each field, I first outline my background by listing the courses I have taken in that area. I then present any contributions or original ideas I have developed within that field, if applicable.  

Similar information has also been compiled for my [[PhD Applications]] in [[Fields_of_Competence_and_Research_13.12.24.pdf]] and my [[Curriculum Vitae.pdf]].
