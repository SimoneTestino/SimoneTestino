I first introduced myself into set theory during the [[1st Semester]] of my bachelor at the [[University of Constance]], during the [[2nd Semester]] I then followed [[Advanced Set Theory (Lecture)]] and got introduced into Forcing. I then used set theory frequently in most of the essays I wrote for my [[B.A. Philosophy (LMU)]] but couldn't find the right place where to deepen my knowledge at the [[LMU Munich]] other than with some helpful discussions with Prof. Peter M. Schuster who then co-supervised my [[Bachelor Thesis]]. At the [[ILLC Amsterdam]] I followed during my [[6th Semester]] the course in [[Rudiments in Set Theory (Lecture)]] and, most importantly, did a research project on [[Forcing (Research Project)]] organised by [Yurii Khomskii](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/khomskii/index.html).

In most of courses I studied on [[Kunen, K.  (2011), Set Theory]].

### Philosophy of Set Theory
I have also always been interested in the philosophical side of it, I visited the 3-days seminar in Philosophy of Set Theory in Pisa with [[Leon Horsten]] and others.
