I followed a course in Philosophy of Logic by [Dr. Alessandra Marra](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/people/faculty/marra_alessandra/index.html) during my [[4th Semester]] at the [[LMU Munich]]. I followed then an analogous [[Philosophy of Logic (Lecture)]]. I submit the linked essay together with [[The Silent Assumption in Tarskian Semantics]].

The essay is available at: [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ypnnsgwsjqzs#25af7f).
