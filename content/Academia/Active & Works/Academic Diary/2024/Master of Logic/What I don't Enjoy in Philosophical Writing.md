In the didactics of philosophy, there are several aspects that I personally dislike. This is not to say that I wish university-level philosophy teaching to be different in these respects, but rather that these particular aspects do not appeal to me. Not only do they make my time at university less enjoyable, but I also believe they will neither help me in my future career nor enable me to make meaningful contributions to philosophy.

One of the most frustrating aspects is that, in philosophy examinations where students are assessed through essays, the evaluation is often based more on the structure and form of the essay rather than its content. A clear example of this can be seen in [[Feedbacks on Bachelor Thesis]], as well as more recently on my work on [[Ontic Structuralism of Concepts]]. I find this particularly demotivating because, while the structure of an essay is undoubtedly important—especially for future publications—it is not my primary focus when writing. Instead, I concentrate on developing original ideas and making genuine contributions to the philosophical debates I engage with.

Additionally, my writing often includes an "excessive" use of mathematical terms, which are frequently deemed inappropriate for philosophical texts. I am often advised to replace them with informal equivalents, which, in my view, are far less precise. This further adds to my frustration, as I prioritise rigour and clarity in my philosophical work.
