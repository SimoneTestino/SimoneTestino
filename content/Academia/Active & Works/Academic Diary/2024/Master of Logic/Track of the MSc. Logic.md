The track that best aligns with my interests in the [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]] is the [Math Track](https://msclogic.illc.uva.nl/current-students/regulations/curriculum/). I plan to take all four compulsory courses during my 5th and 6th semesters:  
- [[Introduction to Modal Logic (Lecture)]]  
- [[Proof Theory (Lecture)]]  
- [[Rudiments in Set Theory (Lecture)]]  
- [[Model Theory, ILLC (Lecture)]]  

However, officially pursuing this track would require counting these courses towards the final curriculum (outlined in the [Spreadsheet: MoL Marks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OjD1LdGdszllAu5bL-Eybfb4XEd2fofWphFoyJliLjw/edit?usp=sharing)), which might not be the most strategic choice. Instead, I plan to also take:  
- [[Meaning, Reference and Modality (Lecture)]]  
- [[Structures for Semantics (Lecture)]]  

Since I already have an 8.5 for the first course and can easily take the second during my [[6th Semester]], this approach would allow me to officially complete both the _Logic & Mathematics_ track and the _Logic & Language_ track, while giving bureaucratic priority to the latter. This way, I would not be required to include all four math courses in the final transcript.

This strategy may not affect my [[PhD Applications in the US]], as I am already applying for them now \[01.01.2025\], but it might influence my [[PhD Applications in the EU & UK]].
