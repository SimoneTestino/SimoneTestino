Currently the best optimal scenario for the [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]] before writing the [[Master Thesis]] is to complete two tracks, following [[Track of the MSc. Logic]], i.e. the one in linguistics and the one in mathematics. One of the two, most likely the one in linguistics, needs to have an average above 8.0, which would allow me to candidate for the cum laude given [5.2](https://assets-eu-01.kc-usercontent.com/2a7f7854-b38e-015d-c63a-62b2c8fa2017/48ae66f9-ce72-4648-a0d8-52be90aa072f/RRvE_MScLogic_september_2024.pdf). With the currently registered courses though, I get to 7.99 :). 

The goals then are two, finish with the double track and have an average above 8.0. The first goal needs either for me to have passed the course in [[Model Theory, ILLC (Lecture)]] or to have it exempted, which might still be an option. For the second goal...

... I see three solutions. 
1. One way is to write the exam in [[Rudiments in Set Theory (Lecture)]], for which I have no motivation or preparation and get a mark that is higher than 7.25 for the whole course, i.e. anything above 6.5 for the singular exam.
2. Asking for recognising another master course that I already took in the past, this could be [[Modal Logic (Lecture)]] at the LMU for which I got a 1.3.
3. The third option is simply to take another course in the next semester (Mastermath perhaps, for which I could follow lectures online) and get a mark greater than 7.3. This could include resubmitting the essay in [[Philosophy of Cognition (Lecture)]]. 

For the case of both the second and third case, if I passed the exam in Model Theory, I would get the course in Set Theory exempted, which should be easily doable.

No no, I have to let another course count instead of Set Theory, this would still keep the amount of credits with a pass/fail not greater than one third (in fact, precisely 30EC), and it would necessarily be recognised as a pass/fail. I would then have one least mark that I can exclude from the Master, which would make me need only for the mark for the final essay of [[Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Lecture)]] to be greater than 6.5.

So the plan is:
- I make the transfer of credits for [[Structure on Models]].
- I get exempted from [[Rudiments in Set Theory (Lecture)]] thanks to [[Advanced Set Theory (Lecture)]].
- I beg to have a decent mark for [[Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Lecture)]].


> Dear Benno,
> 
> I have a couple of questions regarding transfers and exemptions and it would be optimal to receive an answer as soon as possible as it would likely influence the need or not to take a resit in a couple of days.
> 
> I am planning the final credits for the MoL since I am now thinking of taking the next semester abroad completely dedicated to the writing the thesis and working on the research projects and I want therefore to make sure that I am done with the courses for which I have to be present in Amsterdam. In particular I wanted to ask regarding (i) a transfer of credits from one course I took at the MCMP in Munich which is part of the Master curriculum and which I couldn't use to graduate in the Bachelor and (ii) the exemption from the courses in set theory and model theory from the track in Mathematics. I write here a couple of words about the reason of both the transfer and the exemption to give some context and write below the necessary details.
> 
> The reason for the transfer is that, now that I know much better the marks that are going to count for the curriculum, making this course count would allow me to exclude another course with a lower mark and hence manage to have the average above 8.0 which would candidate me for the cum laude.
> 
> The reason for the exemption, despite me being currently enrolled in both courses, is that, for separate reasons about which Nick is aware, I couldn't take the finals and at the time of the resit, i.e. in these days, I am not feeling well. I was initially planning to take these courses anyway, without asking for an exemption, in order to potentially receive higher marks but the current conditions do not make this reasonable anymore. Regarding the track of the MoL though, I am currently planning to complete both the one in Logic & Linguistics and the one in Logic & Mathematics, these exemption would clearly only concern the latter. The average greater than 8.0 refers to the track in Logic & Linguistics.

Also, since it took place outside of the Netherlands it should be counted as a pass/fail, following 6.4. You can find the certificate of the course attached, the material and contacts of the instructor are available here: https://www.johnedougherty.com/syllabi/24w_cats.pdf.

> Regarding the exemption for the course in Set Theory, it should be enough to consider the course in Advanced Set Theory and Forcing that I took at the University of Constance, I am also notifying Yurii about the matter, as I would then not take the resit for his course. During this academic year at the ILLC, I have also almost completed the course in Rudiments of Set Theory, with nearly perfect assignments and 7.8 at the midterm, completed the research project in Forcing and am working on a second research project on Forcing with Urelements also supervised by Yurii. The material for the course taken at the university of Konstanz should be available here: https://www.math.uni-konstanz.de/~brickhill/lehre.html but currently isn't, I have my notes for the course here: https://horreum.pages.dev/1.-Active--and--Works/Bachelor/2nd-Semester/Mathematics/Lecture-Notes/Advanced-Set-Theory-(Lecture); shall I ask to the instructor for a complete description of the content?

> Regarding the exemption for the course in Model Theory, I followed and submitted the assignments for the course at the ILLC and decided to take the resit despite not feeling well nor having had much of a chance to prepare for it, for separate personal reasons. At the university of Constance I also took a course in Model Theory which covered approximately the same material. The course was taught by Dr. Bagayoko (https://vincentbagayoko.neocities.org/teaching/teaching_en), should I ask him for the detailed list of the material? I took notes also for this course: https://horreum.pages.dev/1.-Active--and--Works/Bachelor/2nd-Semester/Mathematics/Lecture-Notes/Model-Theory-(Lecture).

> For both exemptions and the transfer of credits I imagine that I am going to need to send the official request via DataNose but it would definitely be useful, in particular if you are going to be the one deciding for all three requests, to know as soon as possible if they are likely to be accepted.
