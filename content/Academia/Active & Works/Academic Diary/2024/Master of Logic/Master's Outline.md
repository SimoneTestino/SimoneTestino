On this page, I make some general considerations on my [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]] similarly to how I did for the [[Bachelors' Outline]]. Related pages can also be found in the [[Academic Diary]], such as [[Assume I finish the MoL in one year, what then]].

Once completed and upon receiving the [[PhD Applications Results]], I will write here the details of how I planned my master's degree, the results I achieved, and the difficulties I encountered.
