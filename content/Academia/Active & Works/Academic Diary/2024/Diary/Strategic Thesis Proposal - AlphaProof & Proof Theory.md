> [!NOTE] AI-Generated Proposal
> **Research Note**: This proposal was autonomously generated by **AI Gemini 3 Pro** on November 22, 2025, based on an analysis of current trends in AI-driven mathematics and the user's academic background.
> **Action Item**: Review this suggestion to evaluate if a pivot towards a technical Proof Theory thesis could strategically position you for roles in elite AI research labs like Google DeepMind (AlphaProof team).

## The Opportunity: AlphaProof

**AlphaProof** is a reinforcement learning-based system from Google DeepMind designed for formal mathematical reasoning. It recently achieved silver-medal performance at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO).

- **Core Technology**: Combines a pre-trained language model with the **AlphaZero** reinforcement learning algorithm.
- **Formal Language**: Uses **Lean** (a theorem prover based on Dependent Type Theory) to formally verify proofs.
- **Relevance**: This represents the cutting edge of **Neuro-Symbolic AI**—the intersection of neural networks and formal logic.

### Why Proof Theory?

To work on systems like AlphaProof, deep expertise in **Proof Theory** is a massive differentiator. Unlike general ML engineers, a researcher who understands the structural properties of proofs (normalization, cut-elimination, consistency) can contribute to:
1. **Proof Search Algorithms**: Optimizing how the AI explores the space of possible proofs.
2. **Formal Verification**: Designing better feedback loops between the theorem prover (Lean/Isabelle) and the neural network.
3. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creating high-quality formal proofs to train the models.

## Proposed Thesis Direction

Instead of a purely philosophical or historical thesis, consider a **technical thesis in Proof Theory** with a view towards automated reasoning.

**Potential Topics:**
- **Proof Mining in Lean**: Extracting constructive content from non-constructive proofs using automated tools.
- **Neural Proof Search**: Analyzing the proof-theoretic properties of traces generated by LLMs.
- **Structural Proof Theory for Automated Reasoning**: Investigating how sequent calculus variants (e.g., G3ip) can improve automated proof search efficiency.

## Strategic Value for CV

A thesis in this area signals to HR and Research Leads at DeepMind/OpenAI/Anthropic that:
1. You have rigorous mathematical maturity (Logic/Proof Theory).
2. You are aligned with the "Formal Mathematics" agenda (Lean/Coq).
3. You bridge the gap between symbolic logic and modern AI.
