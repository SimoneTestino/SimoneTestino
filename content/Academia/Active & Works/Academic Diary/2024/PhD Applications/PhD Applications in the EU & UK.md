This is a subpage of [[PhD Applications]].

After listing all [[PhD Applications in the US]], I list here those I am applying to in Europe and the UK. The time span for deadlines in Europe seems to be much wider, hence I list the universities in chronological order. Those that have no deadline because they allow applications to be sent anytime will be considered together with those having deadlines in January since I consider applying as soon as possible.
