Today, I received notifications of rejection from both Notre Dame and Oxford as I reported in [[PhD Applications Results]].

Notably, among my [[Suboptimal Scenarios for PhD Applications#Optimal Universities]], Notre Dame was one of the less competitive options, alongside [[PhD Applications in the US#Carnegie Mellon]]—my primary choice, which ranks almost equally with Harvard and Stanford in my [[Research Areas]]. Consequently, the rejection from Notre Dame suggests that admission to many of my preferred universities may prove particularly challenging.

In response, I have reconsidered my alternatives. I am now examining less conventional options, particularly within computer science. For example, there are potential PhD opportunities at the University of London, the ILLC in Amsterdam (where I am currently based), as well as various programmes in Vienna, Constance, and other institutions within this field. A viable strategy might be to commence one of these PhD programmes while concurrently applying during the following year to more prestigious programmes in philosophy and mathematics at institutions such as Oxford, Cambridge, and leading American universities.

This approach, although suboptimal, offers the advantage of continuity; it enables me to pursue a PhD path without forfeiting an entire year. Moreover, a PhD in computer science—even if theoretical—remains highly adaptable for employment outside academia. My principal concern is to secure my financial future and mitigate undue risks.

Thus far, my academic achievements include the A-level, which remains a significant aspect of my profile. However, it is important to consider a secondary, more cost-effective alternative—a ‘B-level’ PhD in computer science. This option, typically spanning three years, might even be expedited to two years in certain circumstances. Additionally, many universities permit a deferral of admission to the subsequent year; such flexibility could prove advantageous if I were to receive offers from institutions like Notre Dame or Princeton. This possibility certainly merits further reflection.

In summary, I am contemplating a flexible strategy that involves initiating an accessible PhD programme while retaining the option to apply to more prestigious alternatives in subsequent cycles. Although this plan may not be optimal, it provides a continuous and adaptable pathway that aligns with both my academic ambitions and financial security.
