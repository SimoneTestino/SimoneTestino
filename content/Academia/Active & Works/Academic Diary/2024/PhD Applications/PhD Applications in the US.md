This is a subpage of [[PhD Applications]],

Following the discussion started in [[Assume I finish the MoL in one year, what then]] and making the same assumptions on the future I made there, I outline when and how exactly I plan to apply to the different PhD positions in the US. I already listed some in the conclusion of the last note: [[Assume I finish the MoL in one year, what then#Candidate PhD Positions]]. In particular, I underlined how the ranking by [philosophicalgourmet.com](https://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/philosophy-of-the-sciences-and-mathematics/) has been of practical use for picking the universities I wanted to apply to.
### General Remarks
For each of the positions I want to apply to, I will need to focus on the writing sample they ask for, which will supposedly be the same for all applications and come from [[Structuralism & Categories (Research Project)]]. I will also pay attention to the deadlines and check if any particular documents are required, I list all of these either here or in [[Attachments to PhD Applications]]. For each university, I not only verify the details of the application process but also identify which professors in particular may be key for my studies at that institution, those names are listed here and more details are given in the specific motivational letters in [[Attachments to PhD Applications]].

I also list [[PhD Applications in the EU & UK]], divided by different deadlines (Oxford belongs to this list and Bristol to the other one, only because of different deadlines). Regarding the [[PhD Applications in the US#Letters of Recommendation]] I list the timeline below and give here all [[Information for Recommenders]].

## Timeline
#### Letters of Recommendation
To make applications I need to be sure that I have people that can refer me, here I list candidates by priority and expose their relation to my work:
- Prof. Merkl, Supervisor of my [[B.Sc. Mathematics Thesis]]
- Prof. Schuster, Cosupervisor of my [[B.Sc. Mathematics Thesis]]
- Dr. Cinti, Supervisor of [[Structuralism & Categories (Research Project)]]

Both Prof. Merkl and Prof. Schuster may not have read the thesis before the deadlines, I need to send them an email to make sure that they will be able to provide an opinion on my work before the deadlines. I will also need to update them of the new projects I am perusing. I will send them an email within **27.10** to make sure that I will have their recommendation letters.

While the research project [[Structuralism & Categories (Research Project)]] proceeds, I will ask the supervisors if they can also provide a recommendation letter, I would then get the 3rd and 4th letter and have solved this issue. I will make sure of that before the **20.11**.

I need then to make sure that those professors writing recommendation letters are aware of my current work and, in order to grant that they will receive a copy of my current [[Curriculum Vitae.pdf]]

### Writing Sample
I will then need to have a written sample to submit of around 20 pages, it will be done before the **01.12** while I begin writing for [[Structuralism & Categories (Research Project)]]. All documents will be organised in [[Attachments to PhD Applications]].

### Berkeley University
- **Deadlines**: 17.12.2024
- **Letters of Recommendation**: 3
- Fee: 155$
- [Application Portal](https://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/steps-to-apply/apply/)
- **Language Requirement**: I am supposed to take a TOEFL exam, taking it at home would in principle be doable but it would require still to organise more paperwork and put more effort into the application process. Despite Berkeley would have been my second option, after Stanford (given the few information I currently have), this constrain is enough to make me give up on this application.
