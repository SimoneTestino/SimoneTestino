I wrote this essay during my [[5th Semester]] at the [[ILLC Amsterdam]] for the course [[Philosophy of Logic (Lecture)]]. The essay is made available at [Overleaf: A Topological Approach to Infinite Disjunctions](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ncnfrstjzdmh#7a160e). I have been influenced for the topic of this essay by the course [[Topology, Logic and Learning (Lecture)]] by Alexandru Baltag. This essay can both be regarded as part of [[Philosophy of Mathematics and Logic]] and of [[Formal Epistemology]].
