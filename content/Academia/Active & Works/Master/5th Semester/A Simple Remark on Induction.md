As I remarked in the second exercise of the first assignment of [[Proof Theory (Lecture)]], it is possibly stronger to do one only induction on one formula (perhaps with more conjuncts) rather than multiple inductions of the separate formulate. This is because one is then allowed to use one unique stronger induction hypothesis.
