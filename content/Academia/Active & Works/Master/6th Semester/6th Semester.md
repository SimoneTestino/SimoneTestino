During the second and final semester (see [[Assume I finish the MoL in one year, what then]]) of the [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]]. The courses I will list, counting the [[Master Thesis]] amount to a total of 18 + 27 + 30 = 75 EC.

I plan to take the following mandatory courses to complete the tracks I am pursuing (see [[Track of the MSc. Logic]]):  
- [[Rudiments in Set Theory (Lecture)]]  
- [[Model Theory, ILLC (Lecture)]]  
- [[Structures for Semantics (Lecture)]]  

Additionally, I plan to attend the following courses:  
- [[Philosophy of Mathematics (Lecture)]]  
- [[Type Theory (Lecture)]]  
- [[Recursion Theory (Lecture)]]  
- [[Topology, Logic and Learning (Lecture)]] 
- [[Logic and Probability (Lecture)]]

The reasoning behind these choices is detailed in [[6th Semester Courses Choice]].
