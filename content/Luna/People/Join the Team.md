> [!ABSTRACT]
> Luna is seeking co-founders and key collaborators to join a funded startup at the ground level. We offer equity-based compensation for early contributors alongside the opportunity to shape an innovative product with clear market validation and patent protection.

## Our Vision for Team Building

The Luna project is structured as an independent entity with ownership distributed among shareholders. We value every contribution at market rates, with premiums for unique skills and strategic impact. Our equity distribution reflects both the value and risk profile of each contribution, with greatest rewards for those joining in the highest-risk early phases.

## Current Status and Opportunity

- ✅ **Patent Filed**: Core technology protected (August 2025)
- ✅ **EU Funding Approved**: [[ColivingLiguria/Financials/Public Financial Aid/FESR Azione 1.3.3. EU Grant|FESR Azione 1.3.3. EU Grant]] accepted (July 2025)  
- ✅ **Technical Documentation Complete**: 700+ pages of validated models
- ✅ **Market Analysis Complete**: €1.7B addressable market identified
- 🔄 **Regulatory Approval**: In process with ENAC/EASA
- 📅 **Prototype Phase**: Starting December 2025

This is a **funded, de-risked opportunity** to join after validation but before scaling.

## Open Positions and Equity Allocation

All positions offer equity compensation reflecting risk level and contribution type. We categorize needs into three risk classes:

### First-Order Needs (Highest Equity)
Essential before customer testing - highest risk, highest reward

### Second-Order Needs (Moderate Equity)  
Important for mature-phase growth - moderate risk

### Demand-Led Needs (Cash + Vesting)
Only necessary after market validation - lowest risk, preferred cash compensation

## Technical Positions

### Materials Scientist

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- Advanced polymer and textile selection for balloon envelope
- Helium permeability optimization
- Optical properties validation (haze, transparency)
- Weather resistance testing and certification
- Material sourcing and supplier relationships

**Required Expertise**:
- Polymer chemistry or materials engineering degree
- Experience with gas-barrier films (Mylar, PET, EVOH)
- Knowledge of optical material properties
- Industrial supplier network helpful

**Why This Matters**:
The envelope material is Luna's most critical component, affecting lift capacity, helium retention, light diffusion quality, and operational lifespan. Current design uses aluminized/non-aluminized Mylar combination, but optimization could significantly improve performance and reduce costs.

**Compensation**: 
- **Risk Class**: Second-Order Need
- **Equity**: 8-12% with vesting based on material performance validation
- **Timeline**: 6-12 month vesting as prototypes are tested

### Robotics & Mechatronics Engineer

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- Sensor array design and integration (accelerometers, inclinometers, thermometers)
- Cooling system optimization (fan placement, airflow modeling)
- Electronics packaging and weight optimization
- Computation center design (Arduino-based safety systems)
- Wiring and power management within weight constraints

**Required Expertise**:
- Mechatronics or robotics engineering background
- Experience with sensor fusion and redundancy systems
- Embedded systems development (Arduino, microcontrollers)
- Thermal management expertise
- Weight-constrained design experience preferred

**Why This Matters**:
Luna's safety and reliability depend entirely on the integrated electronics system. The dual computation centers with redundant sensors must operate flawlessly in challenging conditions (temperature extremes, vibration, weather exposure) while adding minimal weight.

**Compensation**:
- **Risk Class**: First-Order Need  
- **Equity**: 15% for complete electronics & software subsystem
- **Additional**: Potential technical leadership role

### Software Engineer - Physical Modeling

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- Python physical model development and validation
- External fluid dynamics (wind, turbulence, drag)
- Internal fluid dynamics (helium flow, cooling efficiency)
- Optical modeling (illumination patterns, diffusion)
- Thermodynamic simulation (heat transfer, LED cooling)
- Barometric pressure models (helium permeation prediction)

**Required Expertise**:
- Strong Python proficiency (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
- Computational physics or engineering simulation background
- Fluid dynamics knowledge (OpenFOAM experience valuable)
- Thermodynamics and heat transfer modeling
- Scientific computing and numerical methods

**Why This Matters**:
Luna's entire design is validated through simulation before expensive physical prototyping. Accurate models save months of iteration and thousands in material costs. These models also generate the critical parameters used by onboard safety systems.

**Compensation**:
- **Risk Class**: First-Order to Second-Order (depending on phase)
- **Equity**: 10-15% with milestones for each validated model
- **Collaboration**: Work directly with founder on existing codebase

### Software Engineer - Embedded Systems

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- Onboard safety system implementation (Arduino/microcontroller)
- Emergency case detection algorithms
- Sensor discrepancy protocol (dual redundancy handling)
- Dual-channel communication (wired + wireless)
- Real-time data processing within hardware constraints
- Luna mobile app development (user interface, monitoring, controls)

**Required Expertise**:
- Embedded C/C++ programming
- Real-time systems and safety-critical software
- Arduino or similar microcontroller platforms
- Wireless communication protocols
- Mobile app development (iOS/Android) valuable
- State machine design for safety systems

**Why This Matters**:
The embedded software is Luna's brain - it must detect and respond to emergencies instantly without ground connection. This is safety-critical code that must be bulletproof, efficient, and thoroughly tested.

**Compensation**:
- **Risk Class**: First-Order Need
- **Equity**: 15% for complete safety system + app
- **Bonus**: Recurring update responsibilities could include ongoing compensation
