title: Luna Project Calendar - Path to Launch
---
This document outlines the key phases, tasks, and deadlines to move the Luna project from its current planning stage (as of September 14, 2025) to being fully operational.
### Phase 1: Legal & Regulatory Approval

**Deadline:** End of October 2025

This is the most critical initial step. We must gain a clear understanding of the operational boundaries for Luna in Italy before committing to production.

* **Objective:** Define the precise rules for flying Luna in various environments:
    * Private and public areas.
    * Active construction sites.
    * Congested areas and gatherings of people.
* **Action:** Based on the initial research and questions outlined in the [[Legal Concerns on Luna]], it's clear that public regulations are ambiguous. The next step is to engage with a legal expert specializing in aviation law to get a definitive opinion on our specific use case.
* **Contingency Plan:** If Italian regulations are prohibitive, we will pivot to a strategy of manufacturing in Italy for export to countries with more favorable laws.
### Phase 2: Finalize Engineering & Design

**Deadline:** End of November 2025

Parallel to the legal inquiry, we will finalise the technical specifications for the first production model of Luna.

* **Objective:** Lock in the final design based on the **[Luna Type One project](Luna.pdf)**.
* **Tasks:**
    * **Software & Electronics (Simone):** Finalise the code for all safety measures and complete the electronic design for sensor integration.
    * **Mechanical & Material Engineering:**
        * Conduct final experiments to lock in a single size, shape, and material for the balloon envelope and frame.
        * Create a detailed, production-ready 3D model of the central electronics core in Fusion 360, optimised for 3D printing.
* **Dependency:** Success in this phase is accelerated by finding a co-founder with the necessary engineering expertise.
### Phase 3: "[[Luna Garage]]" - Lab Setup & Prototyping

**Timeline:** October - December 2025

We will establish our initial R&D and [[Luna Production]] space to build and test the first full-scale prototypes.

* **Objective:** Create a working, reliable prototype of Luna.
* **Location:** The lab will be set up in collaboration with [[ColivingLiguria]], which will provide the necessary space and facilities for the team.
* **Process:**
    * Develop cost-effective testing methods.
    * Use **hydrogen** for initial inflation tests to minimise costs during experimentation.
    * After validating the design with hydrogen, build and test the final version with **helium** to confirm flight characteristics.
### Phase 4: Initial Market Validation

**Timeline:** Starting January 2026

With a working prototype, we will begin gathering feedback from the target market.

* **Objective:** Validate customer interest and gather testimonials.
* **Strategy:**
    * Identify and approach potential local clients in the event and construction industries.
    * Offer the first Luna units for rent at a low cost (or for free) in exchange for detailed feedback.
    * Use these initial deployments to refine the user experience and build a portfolio of use cases, as detailed in the **[Business Plan](Luna-3.pdf)**.
