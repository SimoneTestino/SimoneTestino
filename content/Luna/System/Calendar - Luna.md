title: Luna Project Calendar - Path to Launch
---

This document outlines the key phases, tasks, and deadlines to move the Luna project from its current planning stage to being fully operational.

> [!IMPORTANT] Master Thesis Priority (Jan - Aug 2026)
> The founder [[People/Simone Testino]] will be focusing on his [[Academia/Active & Works/Master/6th Semester/Master Thesis|Master Thesis]] from January to August 2026.
>
> **Impact on Luna:**
> - **Active Development Paused:** Physical prototyping and commercial launch will be deferred until after graduation (September 2026).
> - **Ongoing Low-Intensity Tasks:** Regulatory inquiries (ENAC/EASA) and patent prosecution will continue in the background.
> - **Team Building:** We remain open to [[People/Join the Team|co-founder discussions]] during this period.

### Phase 1: Legal & Regulatory Approval (Current)

**Deadline:** End of 2025 (Ongoing)

This is the most critical initial step. We must gain a clear understanding of the operational boundaries for Luna in Italy before committing to production.

* **Objective:** Define the precise rules for flying Luna in various environments:
    * Private and public areas.
    * Active construction sites.
    * Congested areas and gatherings of people.
* **Action:** Based on the initial research and questions outlined in [[Legal/Regulatory Research]], we have submitted inquiries to ENAC. We are awaiting official clarification.
* **Contingency Plan:** If Italian regulations are prohibitive, we will pivot to a strategy of manufacturing in Italy for export to countries with more favorable laws.

### Phase 2: Academic Hiatus

**Timeline:** January 2026 - August 2026

* **Focus:** Completion of Master's Degree in Logic and Philosophy of Science.
* **Luna Activities:**
    * Monitor regulatory responses.
    * Maintain patent status.
    * Passive co-founder search.

### Phase 3: "[[Production/Luna Lab|Luna Lab]]" Setup & Prototyping

**Timeline:** September 2026 - November 2026 (Post-Graduation)

We will establish our initial R&D and [[Production/Luna Production|Luna Production]] space to build and test the first full-scale prototypes.

* **Objective:** Create a working, reliable prototype of Luna.
* **Location:** The lab will be set up in collaboration with [[ColivingLiguria]], which will provide the necessary space and facilities for the team.
* **Process:**
    * Develop cost-effective testing methods.
    * Use **hydrogen** for initial inflation tests to minimize costs during experimentation.
    * After validating the design with hydrogen, build and test the final version with **helium** to confirm flight characteristics.
    * Finalize the [[Product Engineering/Software Architecture|software]] for safety systems.

### Phase 4: Initial Market Validation

**Timeline:** Starting December 2026

With a working prototype, we will begin gathering feedback from the target market.

* **Objective:** Validate customer interest and gather testimonials.
* **Strategy:**
    * Identify and approach potential local clients in the event and construction industries.
    * Offer the first Luna units for rent at a low cost (or for free) in exchange for detailed feedback.
    * Use these initial deployments to refine the user experience and build a portfolio of use cases, as detailed in the [[Financials/Business Model|Business Plan]].
