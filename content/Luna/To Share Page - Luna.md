title: Luna - Portable Intense Exterior illumination
---
> [!Abstract]
> This page introduces Luna, an innovative lighting solution designed to offer a superior alternative to traditional light towers. The core principles of this project have been recently patented; therefore, this document provides a high-level overview without disclosing specific technical details. This funded project is backed by an extensive and detailed project plan, and we are currently seeking talented individuals to join our team and help bring this vision to life.

### Our Vision
The goal of the Luna project is to create a lighting solution that is more effective, significantly more affordable, and provides a higher quality of light for both professional and recreational environments. The entire project is built on a foundation of rigorous scientific validation; all designs are mathematically modeled and simulated before any physical prototyping, allowing us to test a wide range of materials and configurations to optimize performance.

While core aspects of our technology are already patented, we have chosen not to disclose the full technical details publicly at this stage. We can confirm, however, that a comprehensive project proposal and construction plan has been developed, ensuring that every aspect of Luna—from the core physics to the final construction—is meticulously planned.

### Current Status
The Luna project has completed the extensive theoretical and design phase. We have developed a complete Python physical model that allows us to simulate and test all essential properties of the device virtually. The project, along with its sister project [[ColivingLiguria]], successfully received notification of acceptance for funding via the [[Bando Pubblico Fesr 2021-2027. OS 1.3]] on July 29, 2025. The next crucial step is the construction of the first physical version, the "Luan Prototype", to validate our models with real-world data.

### We Are Hiring: Join the Luna Team
Luna is a flagship venture within the [[ColivingLiguria]] ecosystem and is actively seeking co-founders and key collaborators to drive the project forward. We offer a unique opportunity to join a funded startup at the ground level, as outlined on our [[ColivingLiguria for Startups and Cofounders]] page.

We are particularly looking for individuals with expertise in the following fields:

* **Material Scientists:** To assist in the selection, testing, and sourcing of advanced polymers and textiles for the balloon's cover and internal frame.
* **Robotics & Mechatronics Engineers:** To develop and integrate the internal electronics, including the sensor arrays (accelerometers, inclinometers, thermometers), cooling systems, and the core computation centers.
* **Software Engineers:** To refine the physical simulation models, develop the onboard "Luna's Algorithm", and create user-facing control systems, such as a mobile application.
* **Sales & Business Development Professionals:** To develop our market strategy and build relationships with initial clients and partners.
