> [!ABSTRACT]
> Luna is not just cheaper; it is radically greener. By replacing diesel engines with efficient LEDs and helium cooling, we achieve a 95% reduction in CO₂ emissions. This page details our environmental impact analysis.

## The Problem: Diesel Light Towers

The construction industry relies on diesel-powered light towers.
- **Consumption**: ~0.5 - 1.0 liters of diesel per hour.
- **Emissions**: ~2.6 kg CO₂ per liter.
- **Efficiency**: < 100 lm/W (often old metal halide lamps).
- **Noise**: 60-80 dB (Noise pollution).

## The Solution: Luna

Luna eliminates the combustion engine entirely.
- **Power Source**: Grid power or small battery/hybrid generator.
- **Efficiency**: **190 lm/W** (High-efficiency LEDs).
- **Cooling**: Passive/Active Helium cooling (No heavy AC needed).

## CO₂ Emissions Comparison

We compare the emissions per hour of operation for a standard illuminated area ($1000 m^2$).

| Metric | Diesel Tower | Luna (Grid EU Mix) | Reduction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Power Draw** | N/A (Engine) | 0.6 kW | - |
| **Fuel/Energy** | 0.7 L/hr Diesel | 0.6 kWh | - |
| **CO₂ Emissions** | **1.82 kg/hr** | **0.15 kg/hr** | **-92%** |
| **Emissions/$m^2$** | 1.82 g | 0.15 g | **-92%** |

> [!NOTE]
> If Luna is powered by a green source (solar/battery or renewable grid), emissions drop to **zero**.

## Transportation Impact: The Hidden Benefit

The biggest environmental win is in **logistics**.

- **Scenario**: Delivering a light tower to a site 50km away.
- **Traditional**: Requires a flatbed truck (High emissions).
- **Luna**: Fits in a standard car or van (Low emissions).

| Transport Leg | Truck (Diesel Tower) | Car (Luna) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fuel Cons.** | 25 L/100km | 6 L/100km |
| **CO₂ (100km)** | **65 kg** | **15 kg** |
| **Reduction** | | **-77%** |

## Compliance with Regulations

Luna positions companies to easily meet increasingly strict environmental standards:

1. **EU Stage V Standards**: Limits emissions for Non-Road Mobile Machinery (NRMM). Luna is exempt/compliant by default (no engine).
2. **Noise Regulations**: Luna is silent (< 20 dB fans), allowing 24/7 operation in residential zones where diesel towers are banned at night.
3. **ESG Goals**: Adopting Luna contributes directly to corporate sustainability targets (Scope 1 & 3 emissions reduction).

## Material Sustainability

- **Reusability**: The Mylar envelope is durable but eventually degrades. We are exploring **bio-based plastics** for future iterations.
- **Recyclability**: Aluminum frame and electronics are fully recyclable.
- **Helium**: We use standard balloon gas. While helium is a non-renewable resource, Luna's sealed design minimizes loss (< 5% per 1000h), making it a responsible user of the gas compared to party balloons.

Luna proves that **sustainability does not have to cost more**. In fact, it costs less.
