> [!ABSTRACT]
> Luna competes with both traditional light towers and niche balloon lighting products. Our analysis shows a clear advantage in cost, portability, and light quality against both categories.

## Competitive Landscape

We categorize competitors into two main groups:
1. **Traditional Light Towers**: The incumbents (Diesel/Hybrid masts).
2. **Balloon Lights**: Niche products (mostly for film/cinema).

## 1. Traditional Light Towers (The Incumbents)

**Key Players**: Generac, Atlas Copco, Wacker Neuson, **LuxTower** (Benchmark).

### Benchmark: LuxTower "Lux M10"
A standard hybrid/diesel light tower used in construction.

| Feature | LuxTower M10 | Luna | Advantage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Weight** | **365 kg** | **< 2 kg** | **Luna (Extreme Portability)** |
| **Height** | 8.5 m | 10 - 50 m | **Luna (Area Coverage)** |
| **Light Output** | ~120,000 lm | 100,000 lm | Comparable |
| **Transport** | Truck / Trailer | Car Trunk / Backpack | **Luna (€0 Logistics)** |
| **Setup Time** | 10 min | 15 min | Neutral |
| **Purchase Price** | **€5,200** | **€1,250** | **Luna (4x Cheaper)** |
| **Rental Price** | €150 - €200 / day | €125 / day | Luna |

> [!FAIL] Traditional Weakness
> The "Mast" is the problem. It accounts for 90% of the weight and cost but serves only to hold the light up. Luna replaces the mast with helium, removing the weight and cost.

## 2. Balloon Lights (The Niche)

**Key Player**: **Airstar** (Inventor of balloon lighting).
**Product**: Airstar Scirocco / Sirocco series.

### Benchmark: Airstar Sirocco 2000
A stand-mounted or suspended balloon light, primarily for events and film sets.

| Feature | Airstar Sirocco | Luna | Advantage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Platform** | Stand / Crane | **Self-Flying (Helium)** | **Luna (Height)** |
| **Cooling** | Air (Fan) | **Helium (Convection)** | **Luna (Efficiency)** |
| **Price** | **€3,000 - €9,000** | **€1,250** | **Luna (Disruptive)** |
| **Focus** | Cinema / High-End | Industrial / General | Luna (Scalability) |

> [!FAIL] Competitor Weakness
> Existing balloon lights are often "dumb" diffusers put on a stick or hung from a crane. They lack the **autonomous flight** and **active thermal management** that make Luna a standalone infrastructure replacement.

## The "Blue Ocean" Strategy

Luna creates a new market space:
- **Cheaper** than industrial towers.
- **More Capable** (higher altitude) than stand-mounted balloons.
- **Smarter** (IoT/Safety) than both.

### Transportation Cost: The Hidden Killer
For a rental company, moving a 400kg tower costs ~€150-300 (truck, driver, fuel).
Moving Luna costs **€0** (fits in the technician's van).
$\rightarrow$ **This logistics saving alone pays for the helium.**
