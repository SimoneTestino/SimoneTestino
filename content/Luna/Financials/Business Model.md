> [!ABSTRACT]
> Luna's business model is designed for flexibility and scalability, catering to both the rental-heavy construction market and the sales-oriented events sector. This page details our revenue streams, pricing strategy, and unit economics.

## Revenue Streams

We have identified three distinct revenue models to capture different market segments.

### 1. Local Rental (The "Cash Cow")
*Target: Construction Sites & Local Events (Liguria/Piedmont)*

- **Model**: Direct rental of Luna units including setup and support.
- **Price**: **€125 / day** (Standard Rate).
- **Cost**: ~€50 (Helium + Transport + Technician Time).
- **Margin**: **~60% (€75/day)**.
- **Advantage**: High margin, builds direct customer relationships, validates product durability.

### 2. Manufacture & Ship (The "Scale Up")
*Target: Rental Companies & Large Construction Firms (Europe-wide)*

- **Model**: B2B Sales of Luna units.
- **Price**: **€1,250** (Unit Price).
- **COGS**: **€650 - €750** (Materials + Assembly + Overhead).
- **Margin**: **~40-48% (€500 - €600/unit)**.
- **Advantage**: Rapid scaling without operational overhead. Shifts logistics burden to the customer.

### 3. Subscription / "Lighting-as-a-Service"
*Target: Long-term Infrastructure Projects*

- **Model**: Annual fee for guaranteed lighting availability + maintenance.
- **Tiers**:
    - **Basic (€200/year)**: Priority support, discounted spares.
    - **Pro (€1,500/year)**: Includes 2 replacement units/year + 24/7 support.
- **Advantage**: Recurring revenue, customer lock-in.

## Unit Economics

### Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) Breakdown

| Component | Cost Estimate |
| :--- | :--- |
| Envelope & Frame | €110 |
| LED & Electronics | €250 |
| Cable & Tether | €30 |
| Assembly Labor (2 hrs) | €60 |
| Packaging & Manuals | €50 |
| **Total Production Cost** | **~€500** |
| **Buffer (15%)** | €75 |
| **Total COGS** | **€575** |

### Profitability Analysis

| Metric | Rental Model | Sales Model |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | €125 / day | €1,250 / unit |
| **Direct Cost** | €50 (Ops) | €575 (COGS) |
| **Gross Profit** | **€75** | **€675** |
| **Margin** | **60%** | **54%** |
| **Break-Even** | ~8 Rental Days | ~10 Units Sold (to cover R&D) |

> [!SUCCESS]
> The low production cost allows us to break even on a unit after just **8 days of rental**. This is an exceptionally fast ROI compared to traditional towers (ROI ~12-18 months).

## Pricing Strategy

### Why €1,250?
- **Psychological Pricing**: Significantly cheaper than the cheapest diesel tower (€5,000+).
- **Authority**: High enough to signal quality (not a "toy").
- **Competitiveness**: Undercuts Airstar (€3,000+) by >50%.

### Why €125/day?
- **Market Standard**: Aligns with typical generator/tower rental rates (€100-200).
- **Value Add**: Includes the "wow factor" and zero-emission benefits for free.

## Financial Projections (Year 1 - Post Launch)

*Assuming 10 active rental units and 50 unit sales.*

1. **Rental Revenue**: 
   - 10 units x 100 days utilization x €125 = **€125,000**
2. **Sales Revenue**:
   - 50 units x €1,250 = **€62,500**
3. **Total Gross Revenue**: **€187,500**
4. **Total Costs** (COGS + Ops): ~€80,000
5. **Gross Profit**: **~€107,500**

This projection confirms that Luna can be a sustainable, profitable business with modest initial volume.
