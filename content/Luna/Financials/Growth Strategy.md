> From a garage prototype to a European market leader. This page outlines the strategic roadmap for scaling Luna, funding milestones, and long-term vision.

## Phase 1: Validation & MVP (Current - Late 2026)

*Goal: Prove the product works and people want it.*

- **Milestone 1: Regulatory Clearance**: Obtain ENAC/EASA clarification (Ongoing).
- **Milestone 2: Working Prototype**: Build "Luna Type One" at [[Production/Luna Lab]].
- **Milestone 3: First Pilot**: 5-10 supervised rentals to friendly local customers (Construction/Events in Liguria).
    - **Metric**: Customer Net Promoter Score (NPS) > 9/10.
    - **Funding**: Bootstrapped + [[ColivingLiguria/Financials/Public Financial Aid/FESR Azione 1.3.3. EU Grant|FESR Azione 1.3.3. EU Grant]].

## Phase 2: Market Entry (2027)

*Goal: Establish a repeatable sales/rental model.*

- **Strategy**: "Regime Forfettario" Optimization.
    - Leverage the Italian tax regime for startups (up to €85k revenue/year with flat 5-15% tax).
    - Keep overheads low. Founder-led sales.
- **Target**: 
    - 20 Active Rental Units.
    - 50 Unit Sales.
    - Revenue: ~€100k - €150k.
- **Team**: Hire 1st employee (Technician/Assembly).

## Phase 3: Scaling & Industrialization (2028+)

*Goal: Expand beyond Italy and industrialize production.*

- **Funding**: Seed Round / Series A.
    - Seek **€500k - €1M** investment.
    - Target VCs specializing in Hardware/ConstructionTech.
- **Operations**:
    - Move to dedicated manufacturing facility.
    - Establish distribution partners in DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland).
    - Launch "Luna Pro" (ATEX certified for Oil & Gas).
- **Marketing**:
    - Attend major trade shows (Bauma, SaMoTer).
    - Digital marketing campaign targeting rental companies.

## Funding Strategy

### 1. Grants & Public Funding (Non-Dilutive)
We actively pursue non-repayable grants to fund R&D.
- **[[ColivingLiguria/Financials/Public Financial Aid/FESR Azione 1.3.3. EU Grant|FESR Azione 1.3.3. EU Grant]]**: Secured (July 2025).
- **DBU (German Federal Environmental Foundation)**: Potential partner for ecological innovation.
- **EIT Manufacturing**: European innovation network opportunities.

### 2. Bootstrapping
Reinvesting early rental profits to fund growth.
- **Pros**: Retain equity/control.
- **Cons**: Slower growth.
- **Plan**: Use for Phase 1 & 2.

### 3. Equity Investment
Bringing in external capital for rapid scaling.
- **Trigger**: When demand exceeds our ability to self-fund production.
- **Valuation Driver**: Proven unit economics and IP (Patent).

## Strategic Partnerships

- **ColivingLiguria**: Our incubator and HQ. Provides space, community, and initial network.
- **University of Genoa**: Potential collaboration for aerodynamic validation.
- **Rental Chains (e.g., Boels, Kiloutou)**: The ultimate goal is to become a supplier for these major networks.

## Exit Strategy (Long Term)

- **Acquisition**: By a major light tower manufacturer (Generac, Atlas Copco) looking to green their portfolio.
- **Independence**: Growing into a sustainable SME dominating the niche of balloon lighting.

Luna is built to be a **real business** from day one, with a clear path from prototype to profit.
