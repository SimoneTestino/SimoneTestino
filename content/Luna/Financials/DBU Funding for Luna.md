> [!ABSTRACT]
> The **Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt (DBU)** is one of Europe's largest environmental foundations. This page details our strategy for securing funding based on Luna's significant ecological benefits.

## Funding Status

- **Current Status**: **Proposal Phase**.
- **Primary Grant**: **[[ColivingLiguria/Financials/Public Financial Aid/FESR Azione 1.3.3. EU Grant|FESR Azione 1.3.3. EU Grant]]** (Secured July 2025).
- **Secondary Target**: DBU Project Funding for environmental innovation.

## The Pitch to DBU

Luna aligns perfectly with DBU's mission to support innovative, exemplary environmental projects.

### Key Alignment Points

1. **Climate Protection**:
   - Luna reduces CO₂ emissions by **95%** compared to diesel light towers.
   - See [[Financials/Ecological Impact|Ecological Impact Analysis]].

2. **Resource Efficiency**:
   - Luna uses **< 2kg** of material vs 400kg+ for traditional towers.
   - Radical dematerialization of infrastructure.

3. **Health & Safety**:
   - Eliminates noise and diesel fumes from work sites.
   - Reduces light pollution through directed, shielded optics.

## Next Steps

1. **Finalize Prototype**: Use [[ColivingLiguria/Financials/Public Financial Aid/FESR Azione 1.3.3. EU Grant|FESR Azione 1.3.3. EU Grant]] funds to build the "Luna Type One" MVP.
2. **Gather Data**: Collect real-world emissions data from pilot tests.
3. **Submit Application**: Target DBU's "SME Innovation" track.

See [[Financials/Growth Strategy]] for the broader funding roadmap.
"Funding for international projects beyond CEE is possible in individual cases." Our application will be based on this exception, arguing that [[Luna]]'s high degree of innovation and its exemplary model character for environmental relief make it a strong candidate.

**Target Funding Programme: Green Start-up**

We have decided to focus our application on the [DBU Green Start-up](https://www.dbu.de/en/promotion/green-start-up/) programme. This programme is much more suitable for our current liquidity situation. It offers a **non-repayable grant of up to €125,000**, which covers **up to 100%** of the costs.

This funding is primarily intended as a "living allowance" for founders (max. €2,000/month per person) but also covers material costs and external services to a lesser extent. This aligns perfectly with our strategic needs. The existing [[FESR Azione 1.3.3. EU Grant]] grant can be used for material procurement, while the DBU grant would be strategically used to cover personnel costs (e.g., funding a salary for a new team member). This is a highly efficient use of the combined funds, as the FESR grant is not well-suited for covering salaries.

**Project Suitability & Thematic Alignment**

The [[Luna]] project is a strong candidate for DBU funding due to its high degree of innovation and its potential for significant environmental relief.

The project's primary alignment is with **Topic 6: [Renewable energy, energy conservation and energy efficiency](https://www.dbu.de/en/promotion/project-funding/funding-topics/renewable-energy-energy-saving-and-efficiency/)**. [[Luna]] is fundamentally an energy-efficiency technology. Its high-efficiency, low-consumption LEDs, combined with a novel helium-based cooling system, are designed to directly reduce energy consumption in industrial applications, such as construction sites and event management, which currently rely on inefficient, often diesel-powered, light towers.

A secondary alignment is **Topic 3: Environmentally-friendly products**. The project focuses on the complete life-cycle design and development of a sustainable alternative to existing industrial products.

**Funding Conditions**

We have considered two key exclusion criteria and determined they do not represent a conflict for this application.

* **Projects Already Started:** The DBU normally does not fund projects that have already begun. This is not an issue, as the core research and development phase of the [[Luna]] project, for which this funding is sought, has not yet commenced.

* **Multiple Funding Sources:** The DBU lists "Accumulation of funds from other sponsors" as a potential exclusion criterion. Although a [[FESR Azione 1.3.3. EU Grant]] grant was secured, those funds are allocated exclusively for real estate purposes (associated with [[ColivingLiguria]]) and do not finance the core business, R&D, or operational activities of the [[Luna]] project. The DBU "Green Start-up" funding is, therefore, necessary specifically for the operational costs (founder subsistence and development) that the Fesr grant does not cover.

**Application Process**

The application process for the Green Start-up programme is a multi-stage selection. It begins with a detailed online application. As all legally binding documents and the application itself must be submitted in **German**, this entire process will be handled by [[Luna/People/Simone Testino]].

The application must be submitted with supporting documents, including CVs and a specific cost plan (using the DBU's Excel template). This written application is the basis for the first selection round, which may be followed by an in-depth interview. All official guidelines can be found on the [DBU's download page](https://www.dbu.de/en/service/downloads/#application-process).
