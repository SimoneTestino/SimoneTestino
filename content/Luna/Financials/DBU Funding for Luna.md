The primary challenge for this application is geographical. The [DBU's project funding](https://www.dbu.de/en/promotion/project-funding/#implementation) is focused primarily on Central and (South) Eastern Europe (CEE). However, the [DBU](https://www.dbu.de/en/) also states that "Funding for international projects beyond CEE is possible in individual cases." Our application will be based on this exception, arguing that Luna's high degree of innovation and its exemplary model character for environmental relief make it a strong candidate.

**Project Suitability & Topic Alignment**

The Luna project is a strong candidate for DBU funding due to its high degree of innovation and its potential for significant environmental relief.

The project's primary alignment is with **Topic 6: Renewable energy, energy conservation and energy efficiency**. Luna is fundamentally an energy-efficiency technology. Its high-efficiency, low-consumption LEDs, combined with a novel helium-based cooling system, are designed to directly reduce energy consumption in industrial applications like construction sites and event management, which currently rely on inefficient, often diesel-powered, light towers.

A secondary alignment is **Topic 3: Environmentally-friendly products**. The project focuses on the complete life-cycle design and development of a sustainable alternative to existing industrial products.

**Funding Conditions**

We have considered two key exclusion criteria and determined they do not represent a conflict for this application.

* **Projects Already Started:** The DBU normally does not fund projects that have already begun. This is not an issue, as the core research and development phase of the Luna project, for which this funding is sought, has not yet commenced.

* **Multiple Funding Sources:** The DBU lists "Accumulation of funds from other sponsors" as a potential exclusion criterion. While a Fesr 2021-2027 grant was secured, those funds are allocated exclusively for real estate purposes (associated with [[ColivingLiguria]]) and do not finance the core business, R&D, or operational activities of the [[Luna]] project. Therefore, funding is still required for Luna's development and implementation.

**Application Process**

The DBU application is a two-stage process. The first step is the submission of a "Project sketch" (Projektskizze), which should be between 5 and 12 pages. If this sketch is evaluated positively, the DBU will then solicit a complete, formal application. All official guidelines and templates for this process can be found on the [DBU's download page](https://www.dbu.de/en/service/downloads/#application-process).
