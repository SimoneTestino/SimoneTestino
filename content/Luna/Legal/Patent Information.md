> [!ABSTRACT]
> Intellectual Property protection is a cornerstone of Luna's value proposition. We have filed for patent protection on the core innovations that make an autonomous, helium-cooled lighting balloon possible.

## Patent Status

- **Status**: **Filed / Pending**
- **Filing Date**: **August 2025**
- **Jurisdiction**: Italy (with option to extend to PCT/Europe within 12 months).

## Core Claims

The patent application covers the specific integration of technologies that differentiates Luna from generic balloon lights.

### 1. The Helium Cooling Method
*The use of the lifting gas as a primary heat transfer medium.*
- **Claim**: A system where forced convection of the lifting gas (helium) is used to cool the light source (LEDs) and transfer heat to the envelope for dissipation.
- **Innovation**: Eliminates the need for heavy heatsinks or external air intake (which introduces impurities).

### 2. The Autonomous Safety Architecture
*The specific logic of the fail-safe system.*
- **Claim**: A dual-redundant sensor and control system that autonomously manages internal pressure, temperature, and lift (via helium release) without ground intervention.
- **Innovation**: Enables "unmanned" operation, classifying the device as a safe infrastructure tool rather than a piloted aircraft.

### 3. The Stabilization Geometry
*The specific 3-point anchoring ratio.*
- **Claim**: The specific ratio of tether length to balloon height ($d \approx 2h$) combined with the internal load distribution frame.
- **Innovation**: Maximizes stability in high winds with minimal material weight.

## IP Strategy

1. **Defensive**: Prevent competitors (especially large incumbents) from copying our specific cooling and safety innovations.
2. **Valuation**: Increases the company's value for potential investors or acquirers.
3. **Licensing**: Potential to license the "Helium Cooling Core" technology to other aerial platforms (e.g., tethered drones, communication relays).

## Freedom to Operate

We have conducted a preliminary search of existing patents (e.g., Airstar's portfolio).
- Most early balloon light patents have expired (20+ years).
- Our specific "Helium Cooling" approach appears novel and distinct from existing "Air Cooled" or "Passive" designs.
