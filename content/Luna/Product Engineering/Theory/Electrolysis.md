To reduce costs during the testing phase of [[Luna Production]], we plan to substitute expensive helium with low-purity hydrogen produced on-site. This will be achieved through homemade electrolysis within the [[Luna Lab]], allowing for cheaper and more frequent experimentation. The theoretical basis for this process is outlined in this video: [YT](https://youtu.be/zMLNHm4nUCQ?si=IZ5ZRnqd_02aIdDa).

Below is the initial plan outlining the necessary components, estimated costs, and the proposed methodology for building and operating the electrolysis system.
