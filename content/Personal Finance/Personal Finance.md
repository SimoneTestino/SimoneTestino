This page primarily functions as a homepage, containing only links to other pages that provide details on different aspects of my financial situation.

The two most important aspects of my financial life are [[Investments]] and [[Jobs]], as they provide a clear picture of both my cash flow situation and the evolution of my net worth.

Additionally, I maintain a [[Financial Diary]] where I collect miscellaneous notes and reflections relevant to my finances. Lastly, I also keep a [[Financial Ideas]] page, which focuses on entrepreneurial concepts. Most of these ideas are purely theoretical and may never be realised, but I enjoy exploring potential business models that I might pursue in the future.
