Approximately 40 people didn't pass the exam in Logic at the UniGe, in the course that Cecco took, I could consider teaching to a little class at 2 - 3 euros per hour by each student for all hours that there is demand for. The rest will then be in June / July, i.e. when I will just be in Genoa. Same thing for the exam in Alegbra.
