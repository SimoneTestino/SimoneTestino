Following the notes I already made time ago on [[Long Time Leverage Investment]] and the resources provided by Ben Felix in [YT: Investing with Leverage](https://youtu.be/Ll3TCEz4g1k?si=REHGNDFvvOfjWRhF) I conclude that it is convenient in my position to have a margin exposure. There are two ways in which I can feasible reach it, first with a [[House Purchase]] which I discuss on the dedicated page and secondly with a direct margin investing which I discuss on this page. The two ways shall be seen as independent as the two operations do not directly influence each other but they both go towards exposing myself to greater and greater financial risks and taking both at full capacity may make tangibly possible unhappy scenarios.

The cheapest way to borrow capital for investing seems to be through the broker that I already use, IBKR, the costs are published and updated on [this](https://www.interactivebrokers.ie/en/trading/margin-rates.php) page for EU. Currently the rates for low amounts of euros with no subscriptions are at 3.6% and at 1.5% for CHF, I note though that the lower or higher rates are solely determined by the monetary policy of that country which are going to affect the currency's value over time and should therefore (assuming efficiency of the market, i.e. without doing any forex trading) deemed equivalent. On the page fore [eligibility](https://www.interactivebrokers.co.uk/en/trading/margin-stocks.php?hm=eu&ex=us&rgt=1&rsk=0&pm=1&rst=101006010801080808) we read:

>	An existing account must have at least USD 110,000 (or USD equivalent) in Net Liquidation Value to be eligible to upgrade to a Portfolio Margin account (in addition to being approved for uncovered option trading).

We can therefore quickly conclude that the current request is not going to be accepted by IBKR.

For Degiro we note that the cost for borrowing EUR is set fixed at 5%, it is though updated on a semester basis as stated at [6.1](https://www.degiro.ch/data/pdf/ch-en/Debit%20Money%20Conditions.pdf#page5), we may therefore attend that date for an update. There seems to be no constrain on the minimal amount that one is to have on the account in order to use margin but to make sure of that I am going to call the assistance tomorrow.
