There are two most interesting ETFs on Japan that seem most interesting, one that tracks a general index and keeps total expenses low and a second one which tracks a small cap index but more expensive. Given the small cap premium, the second option may be favourable, but I think that a diversified approach between both could be a better option. I gave attention to this country as, it seems, Buffet recently made some purchases. My interest is though most driven by the possibility to diversify and find indexes with lower valuation than the American ones.
