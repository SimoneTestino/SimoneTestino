Here I collect those financial details concerning taxation in the Netherlands that interest me directly or for some projects. First of all, for my [[Personal Finance (old)]] it is crucial to be aware of the capital gain tax in the country.
##### AIRE
The Agenzia Italiani Residenti all'Estero is the agency I should register two if I wanted to pay the taxes in the Netherlands instead of Italy, though it would drop any right that I have on the Sistema Sanitario Nazionale, i.e. I would need to pay for the health insurance, whose cost exceed the foreseeable saving from the capital gain tax. In case I will need to pay more taxes (consider for instance [[Futura]], and potentially [[Airbnb in Amsterdam]]), I may reconsider this choice.

Because of this current state, I have to reason to better understand the tax system.
### Capital Gain Tax
As showed in [link](https://www.iamexpat.nl/expat-info/taxation/dutch-tax-system), there is no taxation if the capital is below 57k€, so I will be just fine for a while. To compute it there is a nice [tool](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/nl/box-3/content/hulpmiddel-box-3-inkomen). For questions I can call [this](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontenten/standaard_functies/individuals/contact/calling/tax_information_line_for_non_resident_tax_issues) number.
## Allowances
I apply for the Housing allowance through the [portal](https://mijn.toeslagen.nl/Overzicht) and required assistance calling [this](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/nl/contact/content/belastingtelefoon) number. I also applied for the student finance, and in order to obtain it I submit the [form](https://duo.nl/images/aanvraag-tegemoetkoming-scholieren.pdf) and [further documents](https://www.duo.nl/particulier/student-finance-citizens-eu-eer-switzerland-or-uk/supporting-documents.jsp) (also [[Oudergegevens - Verzoek om informatie.pdf]]), I hence need [[Futura]] to write some documents for me; all of this needs to be submitted before the 3rd February.

##### Income Tax for Airbnb
In this [link](https://www.poundwise.nl/income-from-bed-breakfast/?lang=en) it is well explained how taxes for an Airbnb work. It may be possible to be eligible as entrepreneur, [here](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/nl/ondernemers/content/hulpmiddel-checken-of-ik-ondernemer-ben-voor-de-inkomstenbelasting) are listed the fiscal advanages.
