Something else I may consider regarding the [[House Choice]] is the fact that I may buy the house in a country with low CGT, like [[Countries with Low Capital Gain Tax]], possibly in Europe. This would already pay for a good fraction of the price of the house as the amount that I own to the state because of CGT grows year by year and is going to grow much larger once the invested capital is larger, for instance due to high [[Margin Exposure]]. Making estimates is difficult, but say that thanks to the [[Margin Exposure]] by both bank-leverage and margin-leverage I was to have, in the upcoming 5 years about 200.000 EUR invested, then I could consider about 20.000 EUR average yearly of income from investments, and hence about 5,000 EUR owed to the Italian state due to the 26% CGT in Italy. For five years that would already be something in the ballpark of 15.000 - 30.000 EUR, a significant amount for the house. This though comes with a complication: in fact if we assume that I will be working for a PhD position starting the next year, which remains by a good margin the plan, I will be residing for the vast majority of the time outside of the country where I buy the house and that might bring some complications with moving my residence there.

In order for all of this to make sense though, I will need to make sure that I can keep the residence even though I spend the majority of the time outside that country and this is rarely the case. Also, I shall consider that I may just find a PhD position in Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands or other low CGT countries and this would already solve any CGT problem.
