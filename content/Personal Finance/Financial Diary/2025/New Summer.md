After finalising plans in [[Summer 2025]] and those in [[Assume I finish the MoL in one year, what then]], I'm ready to develop new ambitious plans, acknowledging they may not fully materialise. Once I complete my exams for [[Model Theory, ILLC (Lecture)]] and [[Rudiments in Set Theory (Lecture)]] (which I'm resitting due to the List Scandal), I'll be in Genoa with Nia, dedicating myself to two main projects: [[Luna]] and [[Coliving Liguria]]. Here I'll organise my thoughts on priorities between these projects and other practical matters.

### Coliving Liguria
Regarding [[Coliving Liguria]], the main challenge is [[House Choice]], which has proven quite complex. Initially, I wanted the cheapest option to minimise financial risk, as reaching breakeven with a €15,000-€20,000 house would be easier than with a pricier one, particularly considering help from [[Volunteers]] and my [[Task Management]] plan. 

I then discovered the *Affitto con Riscatto* contract, allowing me to consider properties around €30,000, with an expectation to pay €10,000 in the first year. This arrangement reduces risk by providing an exit option after the first year if cashflow proves unsatisfactory, limiting potential losses. Another significant advantage is that renovation tax benefits (*Bonus Ristrutturazione* and *Bonus Mobili*) could be claimed by the current owner, allowing me to deduct some or all of the *Accredito IRPEF* from my rent.

The latest and most promising option is applying for public funding for [[Coliving Liguria]] as a formal business, potentially classified as a B&B, hostel, hotel or similar (these options require further comparison). This approach offers greater potential with potentially manageable risk, as the starting capital would be significantly higher, increasing chances of success compared to poorly-funded operations. This would expand the house budget to €80,000-€100,000.

This last option though comes with a lot of uncertainties and complications that follow from filling in all the necessary bureaucracy. This would completely overwrite the [[House Choice]] and its methodologies like [[House Choice#Location]] but also the [[ColivingLiguria/System/Calendar]]. Given the financial convenience of this though, it rightfully has all the priority over the alternatives, to the point that it might become a necessary condition for the project to take place.
