As part of my [[Diary]], I collect on this page various reasonings about my [[Personal Finance]] that are either bound to the specific time in which I am writing them or not particularly well-formed yet to deserve their own page. The years always refer to the academic year starting in September and ending in August.

> [!Warning] Missing Pages  
> As with other notes in [[Personal Finance]], some of these pages might not be made public in the months after being written.
