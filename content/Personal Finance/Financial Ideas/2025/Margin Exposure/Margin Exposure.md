Following the notes I already made time ago on [[Long Time Leverage Investment]] and the resources provided by Ben Felix in [YT: Investing with Leverage](https://youtu.be/Ll3TCEz4g1k?si=REHGNDFvvOfjWRhF) I conclude that it is convenient in my position to have a margin exposure. There are two ways in which I can feasible reach it, first with a [[House Purchase]] which I discuss on the dedicated page and secondly with a direct margin investing which I discussed in [[Again on Margin Investing]] give more details about on this page.
