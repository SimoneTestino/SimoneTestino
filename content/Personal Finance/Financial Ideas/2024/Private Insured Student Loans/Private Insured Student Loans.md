On this page, I briefly present and collect all other pages relevant to the business idea. The initial sketch of the idea is available at [[Private Insured Student Loans (sketch)]]. On this page I first present the [[Private Insured Student Loans#Necessary Conditions]] for the feasibility of the project and then quickly present and give references for all [[Private Insured Student Loans#Services]] that the company would provide to its customers.
## Necessary Conditions
I begin here my listing those conditions that are necessary to start the company. These are not yet the very first steps I would need to take to properly begin with the business plan and have the first cashflow but are jsut those conditions that must be met before even beginning to think about a proper business plan.

The primary conditions are [[Legislative Constrains in Private Debt Contracts]], i.e. all limitations and taxes to agreements between any private lender and borrower.
## Services
I now focus on the services that the company will provide, which can be broadly divided into three categories: [[Private Insured Student Loans#Matchmaking Services]], [[Private Insured Student Loans#Financial Services]] and [[Private Insured Student Loans#Legal Services]]. Below, I provide a brief overview of these services and refer the reader to the respective links for a more detailed exposition.
##### Matchmaking Services
The company's primary role will be to ensure that both the borrower and the investor can be trusted and are capable of fulfilling the terms of their agreement. Customers will gain access to the platform by paying an _application fee_ and undergoing an application process. These processes are clearly distinguished: one is the [[Borrower Application]], and the other is the [[Investor Application]].

The company provides a platform where customers can find the perfect match. Preferences will be set based on the specific terms each customer prefers for the contract, such as selecting different types of [[Contract Exempla]]. However, the most significant matching criterion will be the field of expertise. The primary motivation for entering into these contracts is not just the interest gains for investors or the lower risk for borrowers; but more importantly, the opportunity for investors to positively influence the outcome of their investment., borrowers, in turn, will directly benefit from this influence.
##### Financial Services
The first financial service provided will be access to [[Contract Exempla]], offering both investors and borrowers a clear template of what their agreement will look like.

Additionally, virtual or in-person meetings with financial advisors specialising in the student loan sector will be available. These meetings will ensure that both parties fully understand the terms of the contract before proceeding.

The company will also provide a wide range of data, statistics, and calculations to ensure that both borrowers and investors have a clear understanding of interest rates and risk margins. This will allow both parties to access a neutral and objective reference for interest rates, provided by the company as a disinterested third party. For maintaining full honesty of the company, it is in fact crucial that the profits of the company are not dependent on the investors' nor the borrowers' profit.
##### Legal Services
Finally, if any issues arise during the process—such as one party failing to meet the agreed-upon terms—legal assistance will be provided at no cost. The company will ensure that all payments and obligations are fulfilled as originally agreed upon.
