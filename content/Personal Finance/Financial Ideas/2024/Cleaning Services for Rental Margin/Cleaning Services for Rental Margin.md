> [!Abstract] Abstract
> The core idea is to rent or buy a large flat or house and hire someone to live in the house, keeping it clean and cooking for all its residents. This setup allows me to charge higher rent, making a margin on these services. The idea also includes the option of having an Airbnb within the house.

In this page, I present the project in detail but keeping it in general terms, since it currently is [[Cleaning Services for Rental Margin#Nothing more than a Sketch]]. The plan is divided into two parts: first, I introduce the necessary components to provide the supply, and then I analyse the steps required to assess and attract demand.
#### Supply
The fundamental components needed to offer the supply for this project are a [[3. ExAcademia/Personal Finance/Financial Ideas/2024/Cleaning Services for Rental Margin/House]] and an [[Employee]]. To make the margin significant, a large portion of the employee's income should be spent on their stay in the house, without occupying a space that a paying customer could use. This stay should either be in a living room or my own bedroom, I currently assume the latter.

To secure these two essential elements, I will:
- Find the right [[Employee]] by through the steps highlighted in the [[Employee Admission Process]] and I begin by promoting the [[Job Offer]].
- Focus on accommodation and find the right [[3. ExAcademia/Personal Finance/Financial Ideas/2024/Cleaning Services for Rental Margin/House]] right after the [[PhD Applications Results]] are released.
#### Demand
The most crucial aspect of the project is not merely the tools needed for supply, which I am confident can be managed with appropriate timing and financial resources. The critical factor for the project's success is ensuring there are people willing to pay for the services. To verify this, I will create a page titled [[Simone's House]], showcasing the services offered, and share it with various university social groups online to gauge interest and responses.

The primary target for this product is not only students but also single individuals or couples who are particularly busy and appreciate having someone manage household tasks. The plan includes having the [[Employee]] handle all meals, which should further enhance the profit margins.

A secondary source of income will be an [[Airbnb Project]] within the same household. Assuming that having guests will not bother the residents, which is a personal matter to be checked beforehand, the [[Employee]] will also manage the Airbnb section of the house.

##### Nothing more than a Sketch
Any details provided on this page or related pages are solely for planning purposes and may never be implemented. As of this writing, the [[PhD Applications Results]] are not yet available, so I cannot predict the city where I will live. All information provided here is merely a conceptual sketch, with all legal, fiscal, financial, and bureaucratic details still needing thorough review.
