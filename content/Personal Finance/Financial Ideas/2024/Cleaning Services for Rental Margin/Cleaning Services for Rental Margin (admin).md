Hiring a woman from a third-world country to work in my house, wherever I live after the [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]] (see [[Assume I finish the MoL in one year, what then]]). This would involve having a woman responsible for cleaning the house and cooking, with whom I could have a personal relationship. It is crucial that the house is spacious enough to accommodate 4-5 other students renting rooms, either through subletting or regular rent if I decide to purchase the property. The woman would clean all common areas and cook for everyone, justifying a higher rent. I would earn a margin on this increased rent, provide the woman living in my room with free accommodation, and pay her a salary. For fun, I will create a page for the [[Job Offer]].

The main challenge is arranging the visa and employment/relationship to facilitate her immigration. A temporary 6-month arrangement could be an option. An au pair agency might be a viable solution, though it may come with costs and requirements regarding the living situation (e.g., needing a private room). It could be an interesting idea, particularly if I consider scaling (which is unlikely in the near future). To sponsor the candidate, it would make sense to use au pair forums or Facebook groups. https://j1visa.state.gov/programs/au-pair#program-sponsors

Combining this with an Airbnb venture might also be intriguing.

As a small test and initial task, I would ask candidates to create a new Instagram profile featuring, for example, three pictures of themselves, three pictures of dishes they’ve prepared, and similar content, to evaluate their effort and creativity. Additional tasks, such as using Obsidian or managing emails, could also be interesting.
