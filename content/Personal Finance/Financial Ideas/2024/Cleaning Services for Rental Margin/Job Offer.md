> [!Abstract] In two lines
> I am offering a job starting September 2025 in a house where there will both be permanent residents, like me, and tourist staying as in a bed and breakfast; your duties will include maintaining the house and preparing food. The total compensation is around $2500, from which rent, food, flights, and any other expenses can be deducted.

On this page, you can find all the details for the job offer I am proposing and the papers and information you need to provide to apply. I will be accepting applications over the next few months and will decide on the perfect candidate once I have reviewed all submissions!

> [!Warning] Read Carefully!!
> Please read this page and all documents you sign and submit carefully. Attention to detail and precision are fundamental skills necessary for the job! Mistakes or inaccuracies in submitting documents will be considered in the evaluation process.

To begin with, it is crucial for me to ensure that all documents you send are valid and official. Keep in mind that this is an open offer, and our relationship cannot yet be based on trust. For this reason, you will initially bear all costs required to travel to the location and obtain the necessary documents. You can then present the receipts for reimbursement after successful employment.

### The Offer and Your Prerequisites
> [!Tip] My Offer  
> You will receive valid employment in _City_, allowing you to reside there. You will share a room, with each of you having a separate bed. Food expenses throughout your employment will also be covered. Additionally, the costs for your flight, passport, and visa can be deducted from your first cash salaries. The remaining amount from the total compensation, after these deductions, will be provided to you in cash.

##### Your Tasks
You will be employed for **4 - 6 hours a day**, primarily focusing on _keeping the house clean and organised_ for the residents and customers of the bed and breakfast, whether they are living in the house or visiting. You will also be responsible for _cooking 2 - 3 meals per day_ for all residents and clients of the bed and breakfast.  The amount of fixed residents in the house and rooms used to offer a bed and breakfast, thorough [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com), is currently uncertain but you can expect there to be 3 to 5 clients on a daily basis excluding me and you.

Depending on your skills, you will be given a variety of other tasks that can help organise the business. These tasks can be in the customer care, both digital an in person for the residents and clients of the Airbnb or also keeping track of the finances of the activity from a digital spreadsheet.
##### Skills Required and Evaluation Criteria
The following conditions are _not mandatory_ but highly recommended and will be considered during the selection process:
- Highly motivated
- Being always precise, clean and punctual
- Proficiency in spoken English
- Good cooking skills in various cuisines
- Age between 18 and 25
- Strong social skills and the ability to make friends easily

That said, it is important to emphasise that **all candidates** are encouraged to apply! Being highly motivated to move to a new country and start the job is the main quality I am looking for.

### The Application Process
To complete your application, send an email to [simone.testino@gmail.com](mailto:simone.testino@gmail.com) containing the required documents.

> [!warning] Do Not Forget Documents!
> It is important that you send me one single email containing all required documents. If any are missing, mention it in the email and provide the respective reasons.

##### Identification
The first documents needed are your identification documents to ensure all information in your application is correct and honest. Since our relationship is not trust-based yet, it needs to remain formal and professional. Please send a scan of both sides of your **Identity Card**. If you have a passport, also include a scan of it.
##### The Application Form
To simplify the application process, I have prepared a form with all the necessary details required for your application.

> [!abstract] Application Form
> You can download and edit the PDF: [[Application_Form.pdf]]. If you don't have access to a computer, you can fill it in directly on your phone. If you are unable to fill out the form, simply write the answers to the questions in the body of your email.

Keep in mind that there will be several candidates applying, and the sooner you apply, the more priority you will be given. If you want to understand _how_ this project will be made possible, read [[Cleaning Services for Rental Margin]] and, in particular, learn how the [[Employee Admission Process]] works.
