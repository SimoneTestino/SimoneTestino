Taking inspiration from former projects like [[Airbnb in Amsterdam]], I will consider setting up an [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com) in the same house where I will experiment with the project [[Cleaning Services for Rental Margin]]. The person accepting the [[Job Offer]] would then be responsible for almost all tasks related to the customers and the activity, primarily including cleaning, welcoming guests to their rooms, and preparing breakfast (and potentially lunch and dinner) for the customers.

Once the [[PhD Applications Results]] are released, the main goal will be to compare the revenues from the [[Airbnb Project]] and the [[Cleaning Services for Rental Margin (admin)]] in the chosen city. In this comparison, I should also consider that the [[Airbnb Project]] will require more skills from the person accepting the [[Job Offer]], but it may offer the possibility of obtaining a proper working visa.
