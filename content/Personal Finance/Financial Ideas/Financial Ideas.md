This page may be seen as a sort of [[Diary]], with the crucial difference that I have elaborated on some of the ideas below in more detail. However, some of these ideas remain tied to a specific geographic region I have lived in and are therefore not entirely time-independent. Additionally, since I am most motivated to realise them immediatel y after writing them down, it is valuable to collect them in temporal order. The years always refer to the academic year starting in September and ending in August.

> As with other notes in [[Personal Finance]], some of these ideas—particularly those I may invest time in realising—might not be made public in the months after being written.
