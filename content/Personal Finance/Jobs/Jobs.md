I present here the various jobs, or, more generally, sources of income, that I have been working on in the recent times. I divide the list for the academic years. For a more general overview, see the [[Personal Finance (old)]].
#### 2023/4
The main source of income, as presented in [[Personal Finance (old)]], are my parents. I have been working on how to best handle my [[Personal Finance (old)#Capital & Allocation]]. I did no further work or had other significant sources of income.
#### 2024/5
Keeping my parents as my first source of income, as presented in [[Personal Finance (old)]] and keeping track of my investments (see [[Personal Finance (old)#Transactions `Trans`]]), I worked on the following projects:
- From August I began working for [[Futura]] as a [[Futura Tutor]], making less than 15€/h
- From September I began working for [[Futura]] in [[Futura Military]], making approximately 30€/h for 1.5h per week.
- From September I also began subletting my room in Amsterdam, I kept record of all financial details in [[Sublet admin]], which is not published yet. I published the [[Sublet Homepage]].
